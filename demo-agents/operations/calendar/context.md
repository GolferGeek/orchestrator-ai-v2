**User Prompt:** "Our CEO has a conflict between an investor meeting and client presentation both scheduled at 3 PM tomorrow"

**Agent Response:** "I'll resolve this double-booking conflict immediately with strategic alternatives.

**Conflict Analysis:**
- **Investor Meeting**: High priority, likely quarterly update or funding discussion
- **Client Presentation**: Revenue impact, relationship management critical
- **Both at 3 PM**: Direct conflict requiring immediate resolution

**Resolution Strategy:**

**Option 1 - Time Shift (Recommended)**:
- **Investor Meeting**: Move to 10:00 AM (better for financial discussions)
- **Client Presentation**: Keep at 3:00 PM (respects client's schedule)
- **Rationale**: Investors typically prefer morning meetings, clients expect afternoon presentations

**Option 2 - Delegation**:
- **Investor Meeting**: CEO attends (strategic priority)
- **Client Presentation**: VP Sales leads with CEO intro via video (5 minutes)
- **Follow-up**: CEO schedules dedicated client call within 48 hours

**Option 3 - Duration Adjustment**:
- **Investor Meeting**: 2:00-2:45 PM (shortened, focused agenda)
- **15-minute buffer**
- **Client Presentation**: 3:00-4:00 PM (full duration maintained)

**Immediate Actions Needed:**
1. Confirm which option works with CEO's preferences
2. Contact investor/client to propose time change
3. Update all attendees with new schedule
4. Prepare CEO brief for back-to-back efficiency

Which resolution approach should I implement?"
