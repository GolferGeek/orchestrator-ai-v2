## Initial Configuration

Set up basic development tools and access.

### ⭐ Verify API access and credentials

Test your API keys and ensure you can connect to the Orchestrator AI platform. Check authentication works correctly.

### Set up local development environment

Install necessary tools (Node.js, Python, or your preferred stack). Configure your IDE with proper extensions.

### Clone or access code repositories

Get access to relevant codebases. Set up version control if needed.

### Review API documentation

Familiarize yourself with available endpoints and authentication methods. Bookmark key documentation pages.

### Create your first test connection

Make a simple API call to verify everything works. Start with a basic "hello world" style request.

### Set up environment variables

Configure your development environment with necessary API keys and configuration. Use secure storage methods.

### Install required dependencies

Set up project dependencies. Create package.json or requirements.txt. Install all necessary libraries.

### Configure your IDE

Set up code formatting, linting, and debugging tools. Install relevant extensions for your workflow.

### Test your development workflow

Run through your complete development cycle. Verify builds, tests, and deployments work correctly.

## First Agent

Create and test your first AI agent.

### ⭐ Choose a simple use case

Pick something straightforward for your first agent - maybe data formatting, simple Q&A, or basic automation.

### Configure agent settings

Set up the agent's name, description, and basic parameters. Choose appropriate model and settings.

### Test agent with sample input

Run your agent with test data. Verify it produces expected outputs.

### Handle edge cases

Test with various inputs including edge cases. Add error handling if needed.

### Document your agent

Write down what the agent does, how to use it, and any important notes for future reference.

### Add input validation

Implement proper input validation. Check for required fields and data types.

### Create error handling

Add comprehensive error handling. Handle API failures, timeouts, and invalid responses.

### Set up logging

Implement logging for debugging. Track agent execution and identify issues.

### Test with real-world scenarios

Test your agent with actual use cases. Verify it handles real data correctly.

## Development Best Practices

Establish good development habits and workflows.

### Set up version control

Initialize git repository. Create meaningful commit messages. Set up branch strategy.

### Write unit tests

Create tests for your agent logic. Test individual functions and components.

### Set up CI/CD pipeline

Configure automated testing and deployment. Set up GitHub Actions or similar.

### Document your code

Add inline comments and documentation. Write clear function descriptions.

### Review security practices

Ensure API keys are secure. Review authentication and authorization.

### Optimize performance

Profile your agent's performance. Identify bottlenecks and optimize.

### Set up monitoring

Configure error tracking and monitoring. Set up alerts for critical issues.

### Create deployment checklist

Document your deployment process. Create a checklist for production releases.

## Advanced Development

Take your development skills to the next level.

### Explore advanced agent patterns

Learn about multi-agent systems. Study agent orchestration patterns.

### Integrate with external services

Connect your agents to external APIs. Handle authentication and rate limits.

### Implement caching strategies

Add caching for frequently accessed data. Reduce API calls and improve performance.

### Build reusable components

Create shared utilities and components. Build a library of reusable code.

### Set up development database

Configure local database for testing. Create seed data and test fixtures.

### Implement data persistence

Add database integration. Store agent state and results.

### Create admin dashboard

Build tools to monitor and manage agents. Create a simple admin interface.

### Plan for scaling

Design your system for growth. Consider performance and scalability.
