Guides for non-developers working with AI agents.

## Getting Started with AI Development

# AI Development for Non-Developers

## Introduction

You don't need to be a programmer to build AI agents! This guide shows you how to create and use AI agents without writing code.

## Understanding AI Agents

### What is an AI Agent?

An AI agent is a program that:
- Takes input (text, data, files)
- Processes it using AI
- Returns useful output
- Can take actions based on results

### Types of Agents

1. **Simple Agents**: Do one thing well
   - Example: Answer customer questions
   - Example: Format data

2. **Workflow Agents**: Handle multi-step processes
   - Example: Process orders end-to-end
   - Example: Generate reports

3. **Decision Agents**: Make decisions based on data
   - Example: Route support tickets
   - Example: Approve or reject requests

## Building Your First Agent

### Step 1: Define What You Want

Be specific:
- ❌ "Help with customer service"
- ✅ "Answer common questions about product returns"

### Step 2: Gather Examples

Collect examples of:
- Good inputs (what users will ask)
- Good outputs (what you want back)
- Edge cases (unusual situations)

### Step 3: Use No-Code Tools

Many platforms offer visual builders:
- Drag-and-drop interfaces
- Pre-built templates
- Simple configuration

### Step 4: Test and Refine

- Test with real examples
- Get feedback from users
- Improve based on results

## Common Use Cases

### Customer Support

- Answer frequently asked questions
- Route tickets to right person
- Provide product information

### Data Processing

- Extract information from documents
- Format data consistently
- Validate data quality

### Content Creation

- Generate first drafts
- Summarize long documents
- Translate content

## Best Practices

- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic agents
- **Iterate**: Improve based on usage
- **Document**: Write down what your agent does
- **Test**: Always test before deploying
- **Monitor**: Watch how agents perform

## Working with Developers

# Collaborating with Developers

## When to Involve Developers

### You Can Handle:
- Simple agent creation
- Basic configuration
- Testing and feedback
- Documentation

### Developers Should Handle:
- Complex integrations
- Custom code
- Performance optimization
- Security concerns

## Effective Collaboration

### Communication

- **Be Clear**: Explain what you need
- **Provide Context**: Share background information
- **Give Examples**: Show what you're trying to achieve
- **Ask Questions**: Don't assume understanding

### Documentation

- **Document Requirements**: Write down what you need
- **Share Examples**: Provide sample inputs/outputs
- **Explain Use Cases**: Describe how it will be used
- **Update Docs**: Keep documentation current

### Feedback

- **Be Specific**: "This doesn't work" vs "When I input X, I get Y instead of Z"
- **Be Constructive**: Focus on solutions, not problems
- **Be Timely**: Share feedback quickly
- **Be Appreciative**: Acknowledge good work

## Common Scenarios

### Requesting New Features

1. Describe the use case
2. Explain why it's needed
3. Provide examples
4. Discuss priority

### Reporting Issues

1. Describe what happened
2. Show what you expected
3. Include steps to reproduce
4. Note when it started

### Suggesting Improvements

1. Explain current limitations
2. Propose solution
3. Discuss benefits
4. Consider trade-offs
