# Building Agents for Small Teams

## Introduction

This guide helps small teams build effective AI agents without requiring extensive technical expertise.

## Planning Your Agent

### Define Purpose

Start with a clear purpose:
- What problem does it solve?
- Who will use it?
- What should it do?

### Gather Requirements

Collect information:
- **User Needs**: What do users want?
- **Current Process**: How is it done now?
- **Success Criteria**: What does success look like?

### Design the Flow

Map out the process:
1. What input does the agent receive?
2. What processing happens?
3. What output is produced?
4. What actions are taken?

## Building Your Agent

### Step 1: Start Simple

Begin with a basic version:
- Core functionality only
- Simple inputs and outputs
- Basic error handling

### Step 2: Test Thoroughly

Test with:
- Normal cases
- Edge cases
- Error cases
- Real-world scenarios

### Step 3: Iterate and Improve

Based on testing:
- Fix issues
- Add features
- Improve performance
- Enhance user experience

## Team Collaboration

### Working Together

- **Share Knowledge**: Document what you learn
- **Review Together**: Get team input
- **Test Together**: Get diverse perspectives
- **Improve Together**: Continuous improvement

### Best Practices

- **Version Control**: Track changes
- **Documentation**: Write things down
- **Testing**: Test before deploying
- **Monitoring**: Watch how agents perform

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple Q&A

- Input: Question
- Process: Find answer
- Output: Answer

### Pattern 2: Data Processing

- Input: Raw data
- Process: Transform/validate
- Output: Processed data

### Pattern 3: Decision Making

- Input: Criteria
- Process: Evaluate options
- Output: Recommendation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Agent doesn't understand input:**
- Provide more examples
- Improve prompts
- Add clarification

**Agent gives wrong answers:**
- Review training data
- Adjust prompts
- Add validation

**Agent is too slow:**
- Optimize prompts
- Reduce processing
- Consider caching

## Next Steps

1. Plan your first agent
2. Build a simple version
3. Test with real users
4. Iterate and improve
5. Share with team
