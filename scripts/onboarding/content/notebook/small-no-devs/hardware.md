# Infrastructure Planning for Small Teams

## Introduction

Proper infrastructure planning ensures your AI initiatives have the resources they need without over-investing.

## Assessment

### Current State

Evaluate what you have:
- **Hardware**: Servers, workstations, devices
- **Cloud Services**: Current subscriptions and usage
- **Network**: Bandwidth and connectivity
- **Storage**: Current capacity and usage

### Future Needs

Estimate what you'll need:
- **Growth Projections**: How will usage grow?
- **New Requirements**: What new capabilities are needed?
- **Peak Usage**: What's your maximum expected load?

## Decision Framework

### Cloud vs On-Premise

**Cloud Advantages:**
- Lower upfront costs
- Easy to scale
- Managed services
- Pay-as-you-go

**On-Premise Advantages:**
- More control
- Potentially lower long-term costs
- Data stays local
- No internet dependency

**Hybrid Approach:**
- Use cloud for variable workloads
- Keep critical data on-premise
- Balance cost and control

## Budget Planning

### Cost Categories

1. **Infrastructure Costs**
   - Servers/hosting
   - Storage
   - Bandwidth
   - Software licenses

2. **Operational Costs**
   - Maintenance
   - Monitoring tools
   - Backup services
   - Support

3. **Growth Costs**
   - Scaling resources
   - Additional capacity
   - New services

### Cost Optimization

- **Right-Size**: Don't over-provision
- **Monitor Usage**: Track actual consumption
- **Review Regularly**: Adjust based on needs
- **Consider Alternatives**: Compare options

## Security Considerations

### Basic Security

- **Access Control**: Who can access what?
- **Data Protection**: How is data secured?
- **Backup Strategy**: How is data backed up?
- **Disaster Recovery**: What if something breaks?

### Compliance

- **Regulations**: What rules apply?
- **Data Privacy**: How is privacy protected?
- **Audit Requirements**: What needs to be tracked?

## Implementation

### Phased Approach

1. **Phase 1**: Basic infrastructure
2. **Phase 2**: Add monitoring and backups
3. **Phase 3**: Optimize and scale

### Best Practices

- **Start Small**: Begin with essentials
- **Plan for Growth**: Design for scalability
- **Document Everything**: Keep records
- **Monitor Continuously**: Watch usage and costs
