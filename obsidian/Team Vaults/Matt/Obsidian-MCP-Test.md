# Obsidian MCP Test

**Created:** 2025-01-12  
**Purpose:** Verify Obsidian MCP is working

---

## ✅ Status

The Obsidian MCP server is now connected to Claude Code!

**What This Means:**
- Claude can read your Obsidian notes
- Claude can write new notes
- Claude can update existing notes
- Claude can search your vault
- Commands can automate documentation

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Create `/obsidian:*` commands
2. Build automation workflows
3. Auto-generate course content
4. Keep docs synced with code

**If you can read this in Claude Code, the MCP is working!** 🎉
