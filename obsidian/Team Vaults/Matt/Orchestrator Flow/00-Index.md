## Database Migration Preparation

All documentation should:
- Include YAML frontmatter with metadata
- Use consistent cross-reference formats
- Have clear structure and hierarchy
- Be tagged appropriately
- Include completion criteria
- Link to related content

See [Database-Migration-Notes.md](Database-Migration-Notes.md) for detailed migration strategy.
