# SMB AI Adoption: Challenges, Strengths, and Critical Success Factors

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive research from 2025, **78% of SMBs now use AI** in at least one business function—a 43% increase from 2023. However, **only 15% have progressed beyond basic experimentation** to mature implementation. The difference between success and failure comes down to understanding SMB-specific challenges and leveraging their unique strengths.

## Critical Challenges SMBs Face

### 1. Knowledge and Expertise Gaps (76% of SMBs)

**The Problem:**
- 76% of SMBs report insufficient internal knowledge about AI capabilities
