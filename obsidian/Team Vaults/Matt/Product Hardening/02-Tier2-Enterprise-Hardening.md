# Tier 2: Enterprise Hardening
## Future Roadmap - When Enterprise Customers Are Ready

**Assessment Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Target Market:** Enterprise Companies (500+ employees)  
**Deployment Model:** Multi-Region, Cloud-Scale, Multi-Tenant SaaS  
**Current State:** Not applicable - Future roadmap  
**Target State:** Enterprise-grade platform for large organizations

---

## Executive Summary

**This is a FUTURE roadmap** for when enterprise customers are ready. Enterprise companies will have their own consultants and won't use this until some time down the road.

**Key Context:**
- ⚠️ **Not Immediate Priority** - Focus on Tier 1 (small-to-mid-sized) first
- ⚠️ **Enterprise Will Have Consultants** - They'll customize heavily
- ⚠️ **Multi-Region Required** - Enterprise needs global deployments
- ⚠️ **Multi-Tenant SaaS** - Enterprise may want SaaS option
- ⚠️ **Advanced Compliance** - Full SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001

**What Matters for Enterprise:**
1. **Multi-Region & Global Scale** - Deployments across regions
2. **Auto-Scaling** - Cloud-native scaling
3. **Advanced Monitoring** - Full APM, distributed tracing
4. **Enterprise Compliance** - SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001
5. **Multi-Tenant Architecture** - SaaS option for enterprise

**When to Address:**
- After Tier 1 is complete
- When enterprise customers express interest
- When consultants request enterprise features
- When funding allows for enterprise investment

## Conclusion

**Tier 2 is FUTURE work** - Focus on Tier 1 first. Enterprise customers will have their own consultants and won't need this until later.

**Key Message:**
> "We're focusing on Tier 1 (small-to-mid-sized companies) first. Enterprise features are on the roadmap for when enterprise customers are ready and have consultants who need these capabilities. We know what's needed - we'll address it when the market demands it."
