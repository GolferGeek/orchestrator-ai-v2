## Current Testing Context

**Branch**: test-agent-stack
**Started**: 2025-10-14
**Tester**: Claude

**Servers**:

- Browser: Firefox at localhost:7101 (manually opened)

**Testing Environment**:
1. ✅ **Web Server Running** - localhost:7101 (Vite dev server)
2. ✅ **API Server Running** - localhost:6100 (NestJS with hot reload)
3. ✅ **Browser Open** - Firefox at localhost:7101
4. ✅ **Console Monitoring** - Real-time logs from web and API
5. ✅ **Browser Console** - Client-side JavaScript logs and errors
6. ✅ **Code Editor** - Can modify and hot-reload both front-end and API

## Progressive Test Phases (PRD Content)

### Phase 1: Context Agent (Blog Post Writer)

**Tests**:
1. ✅ Create Plan - Can agent create a new plan?
2. ✅ Update Plan - Can agent update existing plan?
3. ✅ Merge Plan - Can agent merge plan changes?
4. ✅ View Plan - Can user see plan in UI?
5. ✅ Delete Plan - Can agent/user delete plan?

**Success Criteria**: All 5 tests pass before moving to Phase 2

---

### Phase 2: Deliverables System

**Tests**:
1. ✅ Create Deliverable - Can agent create deliverable?
2. ✅ Update Deliverable - Can agent update content?
3. ✅ Link to Plan - Is deliverable linked to correct plan?
4. ✅ View Deliverables - Can user see deliverables in UI?
5. ✅ Delete Deliverable - Can agent/user delete?

**Success Criteria**: All 5 tests pass before moving to Phase 3

---

### Phase 3: Plan + Deliverables Integration

**Tests**:
1. ✅ Create Plan with Deliverables - End-to-end flow
2. ✅ Update Plan Updates Deliverables - Cascading changes
3. ✅ Delete Plan Handles Deliverables - Cascade delete or orphan?
4. ✅ Deliverable Status Reflects Plan State
5. ✅ UI Shows Plan-Deliverable Relationship

**Success Criteria**: All 5 tests pass before moving to Phase 4

---

### Phase 4: API Agents

**Tests**:
1. ✅ Invoke API Agent - Can system call external API agent?
2. ✅ Agent Response Handling - Does system process response?
3. ✅ Agent Error Handling - What happens on agent failure?
4. ✅ Agent Timeout - Does system handle slow agents?
5. ✅ Agent Authentication - Are credentials passed correctly?

**Success Criteria**: All 5 tests pass before moving to Phase 5

---

### Phase 5: API Agents + Plan + Deliverables (Build Step)

**Tests**:
1. ✅ Agent Executes Plan - API agent reads and follows plan
2. ✅ Agent Creates Deliverables - Output becomes deliverable
3. ✅ Agent Updates Plan Status - Plan reflects agent progress
4. ✅ Agent Failures Don't Break Plan - Graceful degradation
5. ✅ Complete Build Flow - End-to-end with all components

**Success Criteria**: All 5 tests pass before moving to Phase 6

---

### Phase 6: Function Agents (Image Writers - Global Pool)

**Tests**:
1. ✅ Discover Function Agents - System finds global agents
2. ✅ Invoke Image Writer - Can generate images
3. ✅ Image Deliverable Created - Output stored correctly
4. ✅ Function Agent Error Handling
5. ✅ Function Agent in Build Flow - Works with plan/deliverables

**Success Criteria**: All 5 tests pass before moving to Phase 7

---

### Phase 7: Orchestrator

**Tests**:
1. ✅ Orchestrator Starts Multi-Agent Flow
2. ✅ Orchestrator Coordinates Agent Sequence
3. ✅ Orchestrator Handles Agent Dependencies
4. ✅ Orchestrator Aggregates Results
5. ✅ Orchestrator Error Recovery
6. ✅ Complete Orchestration End-to-End

**Success Criteria**: All 6 tests pass - **System fully tested**
