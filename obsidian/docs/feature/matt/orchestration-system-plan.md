# Orchestration System Delivery Plan — Codex (Builder) & Claude (Tester)

## 0. Overview

This plan aligns all implementation and quality work required to deliver the orchestration system defined in the PRD. Every coding task has a paired testing checklist so we move through the phased roadmap together, stay accountable to standards, and end each phase in a shippable state.

- **Builder (Codex)** – Architecture, services, migrations, implementation, documentation scaffolding. Does not write tests, test helpers, test infrastructure, or run any tests. Does not run linting or formatting. Does not update .env files unless implementation requires new environment variables (documents in task log).
- **Tester (Claude)** – Code review for standards, linting, formatting, writes/runs ALL tests (unit, integration, contract, E2E, load), writes ALL test infrastructure (helpers, mocks, fixtures, harnesses), enforces gates, prepares commits, handles ALL git operations.
- **Human Owner** – Validates happy-path UX at designated gates, approves plan & releases.

> **Note:** We keep this plan as the single source of truth. Each phase expands into detailed subtasks only when both agents are ready to execute, so context stays manageable. (No further split into separate files unless the plan grows beyond ~15 pages.)

## 2. Development Principles

1. **Feature + Tests handshake** – No coding task moves to “Done” until its paired testing checklist is complete and passing.
2. **Phased commits** – Only after all tasks in a phase pass tests & review does Claude create a commit.
3. **Transparent ADRs** – Architectural decisions or deviations from the PRD are captured via ADR notes before coding.
4. **Fast feedback** – Failures trigger the error protocol; issues are resolved before new work starts.
5. **Living plan** – As phases unlock, subtasks are refined collaboratively; changes require both agents’ sign-off.

---

## 3. Git & Branch Workflow

### Phase Branch Lifecycle

**Each phase follows this branch workflow**:

1. **Phase Start** (Codex creates branch):
   - Codex creates new branch from current integration branch
   - Branch name: `integration/orchestration-phase-{n}`
   - Example: `git checkout -b integration/orchestration-phase-1` from `integration/agent-platform-sync-main`
   - Codex begins implementation work on phase branch

2. **Phase Development** (Codex builds, Claude tests):
   - Codex commits feature work to phase branch as needed
   - Claude writes tests, runs them, fixes bugs
   - All work stays on phase branch until complete

3. **Phase End** (Claude closes phase):
   - Claude verifies all phase checkboxes complete ✅
   - Claude verifies all tests passing ✅
   - Claude runs Supabase backup: `./apps/api/supabase/backup-local-db.sh`
   - Claude stages all changes: `git add .`
   - Claude creates final phase commit with message template (see below)
   - Claude pushes phase branch: `git push origin integration/orchestration-phase-{n}`
   - Claude merges phase branch into current integration branch: `git checkout integration/agent-platform-sync-main && git merge integration/orchestration-phase-{n}`
   - Claude pushes merged changes: `git push origin integration/agent-platform-sync-main`
   - Claude deletes phase branch (local): `git branch -d integration/orchestration-phase-{n}`

### Commit Message Template

```
feat(orchestration): Phase {n} – {short descriptor}

- Total: {total_count} tests, {overall_percent}% coverage

🤖 Built by Codex & Claude

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

### Current Integration Branch

- **Base branch**: `integration/agent-platform-sync-main`
- All phase branches created from this branch
- All phase merges go back to this branch
- Human reviews at major gates (Phase 5 & Phase 10) before merge to `main`

### Backups

- Supabase dumps taken at end of each phase, before final commit
- Script: `./apps/api/supabase/backup-local-db.sh`
- Backup files stored in: `storage/backups/`

---

## 4. Error Resolution Protocol

1. **Test Failure or Code Violation Detected**
   - Tester logs issue in `docs/feature/matt/orchestration-issues.md`.
   - Label with severity (blocker, major, minor), affected phase, and owner.
2. **Triage**
   - Blockers stop all new development until resolved.
   - Claude fixes testing issues or standards violations where efficient; escalates implementation bugs back to Codex via the issue log.
3. **Resolution & Retest**
   - After fix, rerun relevant suites plus regression tests for impacted areas.
4. **Postmortem (if needed)**
   - Record lessons in `docs/feature/matt/orchestration-retrospective.md`.

---

## 5. Rollback Strategy

- **Database**
  - All migrations are reversible; before applying, create DB snapshot (Supabase CLI backup).
  - If a phase fails irrecoverably, rollback migrations and restore snapshot.
- **Code**
  - Since commits are per-phase, use `git revert` on the phase commit.
  - Create hotfix branch for clean reimplementation.
- **Agents**
  - Agent config versions tracked via migrations; revert to previous version using archive table or snapshot.

---

## 6. Tracking Artifacts

- `docs/feature/matt/orchestration-task-log.md` – Checklist with timestamps for every task checkbox below.
- `docs/feature/matt/orchestration-issues.md` – Active bugs, ownership, status.
- `docs/feature/matt/orchestration-risks.md` – Risk register updated weekly.
- `docs/feature/matt/orchestration-retrospective.md` – Notes after each phase.
- `docs/feature/matt/phase{n}-standards-report.md` – Code standards review results per phase.

---

## 6.5 Test Environment Configuration

### Environment Variables (Already Provisioned)

**Root `.env` file** contains:
- `SUPABASE_TEST_USER` - Test account username
- `SUPABASE_TEST_PASSWORD` - Test account password
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API key for image-generator-openai agent
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - Google API key for image-generator-google agent
- `SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Supabase service role key

**`apps/n8n/.env` file** contains:
- `N8N_API_KEY` - n8n API key for marketing-swarm agent
- `N8N_BASE_URL` - n8n instance URL

### Test Authentication Pattern (Standard)

**All integration/E2E tests MUST authenticate using this pattern**:

```typescript
// Test setup - authenticate as test user
beforeAll(async () => {
  const authResponse = await request(app.getHttpServer())
    .post('/auth/login')
    .send({
      username: process.env.SUPABASE_TEST_USER,
      password: process.env.SUPABASE_TEST_PASSWORD
    });

  authToken = authResponse.body.access_token;
});

// Use authToken in subsequent requests
const response = await request(app.getHttpServer())
  .get('/orchestrations')
  .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${authToken}`);
```

### Agent Testing with Real Services

**Context Agents** (summarizer):
- Use OPENAI_API_KEY for LLM calls
- Mock LLM responses in contract tests
- Use real API in integration tests (with rate limiting)

**API Agents** (marketing-swarm):
- Load N8N_API_KEY from `apps/n8n/.env`
- Use N8N_BASE_URL for workflow execution
- Mock n8n responses in contract tests

**Tool Agents** (supabase-agent):
- Use SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY for database operations
- Test database operations use `public.test_*` tables
- Clean up test data in `afterEach` hooks

**Function Agents** (image-generator-openai, image-generator-google):
- Use OPENAI_API_KEY and GOOGLE_API_KEY respectively
- Mock image generation in contract tests (no API calls)
- Use real APIs in integration tests (budget: 10 images/day)

**Orchestrator Agents** (image-orchestrator, finance-manager):
- Compose other agents, use their respective keys
- E2E tests use real agent network
- Mock agent responses for unit tests

### Test Data Management

**Database Fixtures** (Phase 0):
- `global` organization created by seed script
- Test agents seeded in Phase 0 (line 115-119)
- Test orchestration definitions seeded in Phase 4-5

**Test Isolation**:
- Each test suite creates unique test data with UUID prefixes
- `afterEach` hooks clean up test data
- Integration tests use transactions (rollback after test)

### CI Environment Variables

All environment variables from root `.env` are available in CI (GitHub Actions secrets).
Tests run in CI will have identical configuration to local development.

- [ ] (B) Production readiness documentation (0.5d)
  - Document required production setup in `docs/feature/matt/production-readiness-checklist.md`
  - List security requirements (sandboxing, SQL injection prevention, AuthN/Z, etc.)
  - Document backup procedures, monitoring dashboards, alert thresholds
- [ ] (T) Security audit & production verification (1.25d)
  - Verify agent execution sandboxing
  - Verify parameterized SQL queries only (block injection vectors)
  - Verify AuthN/Z enforced on all orchestration endpoints
  - Verify sensitive data scrubbed from logs (API keys, credentials)
  - Verify rate limiting on orchestration execution APIs
  - Verify webhook signature verification & replay protection
  - Execute full checklist in staging environment
- [ ] (T) Final regression suite (all phases) + coverage summary (1d)
- [ ] (T) Prepare release notes & communicate to stakeholders (0.5d)
- [ ] (B/T/H) Final sign-off meeting; human conducts happy-path validation (0.5d)
- [ ] (T) Final commit & PR to merge orchestration branch into main (0.5d)

**Exit Criteria**
1. Documentation published in `docs/feature/matt/orchestration-guide/`.
2. Production checklist signed by tester & human.
3. Human approves release.
4. Commit: `chore(orchestration): Phase 10 – Production readiness`

## 8. Human Validation Gates

- **Gate A (After Phase 5)** – Human runs KPI tracking happy-path demo; approves or issues change requests.
- **Gate B (After Phase 10)** – Human validates full orchestrator suite; confirms documentation, monitoring, and rollback plans; authorizes release.

## 9. Risk Register (Initial Entries)

| Risk ID | Description | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---------|-------------|--------|------------|------------|
| R-01 | Supabase migrations conflict with future schema changes | High | Medium | Lock sequence of orchestration migrations; run dry-runs in CI |
| R-02 | External agent APIs (OpenAI/Google) throttle during tests | Medium | Medium | Use mocked adapters in contract tests; throttle integration tests |
| R-03 | Parallel execution introduces race conditions | High | Medium | Comprehensive tests + load testing before enabling in production |
| R-04 | Long-running tests slow CI | Medium | Medium | Tag suites by type; create nightly cron job for heavy tests |

Risks updated weekly in `docs/feature/matt/orchestration-risks.md`.
