Archived Docs — Agent Platform (feature-agent-platform)

This folder contains prior PRDs/analysis docs that informed the Agent Platform work. They remain available for reference but are no longer the active source of truth.

Moved from docs/feature/matt:
- agent2agent-greenfield-analysis-prd.md — early greenfield analysis for A2A
- database-agents-greenfield-prd.md — first-pass DB agents concept
- legacy-a2a-refactor-prd.md — legacy refactor approach (superseded)
- agent-to-agent-controller-prd.md — initial controller PRD (superseded by modernization plan)

Active docs live in docs/feature/matt and the plan at docs/feature/matt/feature-agent-platform-plan.md.
