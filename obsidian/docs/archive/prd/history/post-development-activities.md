## 🎯 **Recommended Approach**

**Phase 1: Production + Core Optimization (Weeks 2-4)**
- **Primary Focus**: Option A (Production Deployment & Testing)
- **Secondary Focus**: Option C (Conversation + Tasks Enhancements)

**Rationale**: The conversation-work-product architecture is working excellently. Real user data and feedback will guide the most valuable feature priorities.

**Phase 2: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-8)**
- **Primary Focus**: Option B (Advanced Feature Development)
- **Secondary Focus**: Option D (Platform Expansion)

**Rationale**: Build on proven foundation with advanced capabilities once production usage patterns are established.

## 📊 **Success Metrics**

### Production Readiness Metrics
- [ ] System uptime > 99.5%
- [ ] Average response time < 200ms
- [ ] Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] User onboarding completion rate > 80%

### User Experience Metrics  
- [ ] Project completion rate tracking
- [ ] Orchestrator delegation success rate > 90%
