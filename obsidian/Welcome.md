So, this is the new team vault.  You should have Obsidian to view this properly... but notice that all of these folders and documents can now be shared by simply committing them with the rest of our code changes.

There is going to be a folder for each of us to work in.  This is a public "vault", so don't have anything in here that can't be shared with the team.
