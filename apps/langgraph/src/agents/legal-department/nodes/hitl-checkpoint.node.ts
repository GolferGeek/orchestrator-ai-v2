 * HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) Checkpoint Node - M12
 *
 * Purpose: Pause workflow for attorney review before final output.
 *
 * This checkpoint node:
 * 1. Pauses the workflow at a designated point
 * 2. Emits a special event for UI to show review panel
 * 3. Waits for external approval/rejection signal
 * 4. Continues or halts workflow based on attorney decision
 *
 * M12 Demo Implementation:
 * - Simple pass-through for demo (approval assumed)
 * - Infrastructure in place for future interactive HITL
 * - Event emitted for UI to show "Review Required" state
 * - Can be enhanced with LangGraph interrupt() in production
