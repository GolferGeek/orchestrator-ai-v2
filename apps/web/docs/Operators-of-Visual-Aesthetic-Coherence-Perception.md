1. Inputs
Color & Luminance
General Rule: Ensure stable contrast, readable luminance, and non-fatiguing color relationships.
Empirical Anchoring: Contrast sensitivity curves, opponent-process channels, and glare-triggered prediction error govern legibility.
Phenomenological Anchoring: Text feels instantly readable; nothing flickers, buzzes, or strains.

Materiality & Texture
General Rule: Surfaces and textures should signal their true physical properties.
Empirical Anchoring: The brain cross-checks visual texture with haptic priors; mismatches spike prediction error.
Phenomenological Anchoring: Materials feel “right,” not plastic, slippery, or deceptive.

Legibility & Typography
General Rule: Maximize symbol clarity with appropriate spacing, sizing, and structure.
Empirical Anchoring: Recognition is faster than recall; crowding effects and foveal acuity limit decoding.
Phenomenological Anchoring: Words snap into recognition without squinting or re-reading.

Perceptual Trust / Truthfulness
General Rule: Keep cues honest—shadows, affordances, and feedback should match real behavior.
Empirical Anchoring: Misaligned cues produce persistent prediction error and break affordance maps.
Phenomenological Anchoring: Interactions feel reliable; nothing feels “fake” or deceitful.

2. Organization
Symmetry & Balance
General Rule: Arrange elements so perceptual weight is evenly distributed.
Empirical Anchoring: Symmetry reduces computational load and stabilizes spatial predictions.
Phenomenological Anchoring: The layout feels calmer and more grounded.

Gestalt Grouping
General Rule: Use proximity, similarity, and continuity to create coherent wholes.
Empirical Anchoring: Grouping heuristics compress information and reduce search complexity.
Phenomenological Anchoring: Users “get” the structure instantly, without hunting.

Hierarchy & Information Architecture
General Rule: Establish clear priority and chunking across the interface.
Empirical Anchoring: Attention allocates in descending salience; unranked elements compete.
Phenomenological Anchoring: Eyes land exactly where they should; nothing feels chaotic.

Signal Isolation & Salient Differentiation
General Rule: Cleanly separate important elements from background noise using disciplined contrast and emphasis.
Empirical Anchoring: Strong figure–ground boundaries reduce saccade demand and attentional search.
Phenomenological Anchoring: The focal point stands out naturally; no scanning or confusion.

Attentional Ecology
General Rule: Regulate attention with stable gradients and predictable emphasis, avoiding predatory salience.
Empirical Anchoring: Inconsistent motion, flicker, and spikes hijack orienting reflexes and overload attentional networks.
Phenomenological Anchoring: Users feel guided rather than pulled, startled, or overwhelmed.

Cultural Schema Awareness
General Rule: Align design cues with the learned priors of the target audience.
Empirical Anchoring: Color codes, metaphors, and reading orders differ across cultures and shape prediction.
Phenomenological Anchoring: The design “makes sense” immediately within the user’s cultural logic.

3. Dynamics
Rhythm & Flow
General Rule: Establish smooth repetition, variation, and pacing across time or space.
Empirical Anchoring: Predictive timing circuits favor rhythmic regularity and moderate novelty.
Phenomenological Anchoring: The experience feels guided and flowing, not jumpy.

Feedback & System State
General Rule: Actions should yield clear, timely (100–300ms) responses.
Empirical Anchoring: Motor prediction loops rely on rapid error correction; delayed or absent feedback breaks agency.
Phenomenological Anchoring: The system feels responsive, alive, and trustworthy.

Mapping & Causality
General Rule: Ensure controls intuitively match outcomes and spatial logic.
Empirical Anchoring: Sensorimotor mapping depends on spatial congruence and consistent affordances.
Phenomenological Anchoring: Users feel they instantly “know” what controls do.

Constructive Surprise (Novelty → Resolution)
General Rule: Introduce fresh deviations that briefly disrupt and then resolve within the design’s logic.
Empirical Anchoring: Prediction systems enjoy uncertainty when it leads to rapid, coherent pattern completion.
Phenomenological Anchoring: Surprise feels rewarding, not random or destabilizing.

Perceptual Problem-Solving
General Rule: Offer mild ambiguity that yields satisfying resolution.
Empirical Anchoring: Completion and disambiguation trigger dopaminergic reward.
Phenomenological Anchoring: The design provides little “aha” moments without confusion.

Memory & Learnability
General Rule: Favor recognition, consistency, and reuse over novel reinvention.
Empirical Anchoring: Working memory limits favor stable cues and minimized recall burden.
Phenomenological Anchoring: The interface becomes familiar quickly; effort drops fast.

Temporal Smoothness / Micro-Dynamics
General Rule: Use biologically plausible motion curves and transitions.
Empirical Anchoring: The visual system expects inertia, easing, and continuous state change.
Phenomenological Anchoring: Movements feel natural rather than abrupt or sluggish.

Narrative Coherence
General Rule: Present events in a logical arc with setup, tension, and integration.
Empirical Anchoring: Humans track temporal causality and reward resolved sequences.
Phenomenological Anchoring: The sequence feels meaningful instead of random.

4. Outcomes
Proportion & Embodied Fit
General Rule: Match scales, spans, and ratios to human bodies and reach.
Empirical Anchoring: Visuomotor mapping and ergonomic constraints shape comfort and accuracy.
Phenomenological Anchoring: It “fits” the body; nothing requires awkward effort.

Embodied Resonance
General Rule: Use shapes and motions that engage motor mirroring and kinesthetic sympathy.
Empirical Anchoring: Mirror systems and embodied simulation influence perception.
Phenomenological Anchoring: The design feels physically relatable and alive.

Harmony & Consonance
General Rule: Integrate elements into a unified percept with minimal conflict.
Empirical Anchoring: Coherent integration reduces prediction error across modalities.
Phenomenological Anchoring: The whole feels calm, balanced, and cohesive.

Complexity Budget / Cognitive Load
General Rule: Limit concurrent novelty streams and manage total perceptual demand.
Empirical Anchoring: Cognitive load scales with parallel prediction demands and working memory strain.
Phenomenological Anchoring: The experience feels breathable and manageable.

Accessibility & Physiological Limits
General Rule: Accommodate diverse sensory, motor, and perceptual ranges.
Empirical Anchoring: Vision variance, motion sensitivity, and motor constraints alter baseline predictions.
Phenomenological Anchoring: Nothing feels excluding, overwhelming, or unreachable.

Exaggeration / Emphasis Tuning
General Rule: Amplify key features to clarify meaning without distortion.
Empirical Anchoring: Feature detectors respond strongly to enhanced edges, contours, and distinctions.
Phenomenological Anchoring: The message feels clearer and more focused.

Affective Regulation
General Rule: Balance arousal and calm to support stable emotional engagement.
Empirical Anchoring: Sympathetic/parasympathetic interplay governs perceptual comfort.
Phenomenological Anchoring: The design feels steadying rather than agitating.

Energetic Economy
General Rule: Minimize unnecessary perceptual and motor effort.
Empirical Anchoring: Each saccade, reach, or figure–ground switch carries metabolic cost.
Phenomenological Anchoring: Interaction feels easy, efficient, and low-friction.

Coherence Debt (Ethical Operator)
General Rule: If you introduce disruption, provide a path to resolution.
Empirical Anchoring: Unresolved arousal and prediction error sustain stress and vigilance.
Phenomenological Anchoring: Provocation feels purposeful, not gratuitous.
