- **Converse Mode Demo**:
  - **Initial Query**: "I want to build a login system for my app"
  - **Agent Response**: Provides quick guidance on requirements structure
  - **Clarifying Questions**: Agent asks about:
    - Scope: Single sign-on? Multi-factor authentication?
    - Constraints: Security compliance requirements?
    - Stakeholders: End users, admins, developers?
  - **Structure Suggestions**: Recommends PRD + TRD approach
- **Key Features Demonstrated**:
  - Quick guidance and scope clarification
  - Structured questioning approach
  - Professional requirements consultation

#### Step 2: Plan Mode - Requirements Structure (2 minutes)
**[Recording needed - Content framework ready]**
- **Transition**: "Let's plan the full requirements documentation"
- **Plan Mode Output**:
  - **Document Type & Objectives**: PRD for user authentication system
  - **Target Audience**: Product team, development team, QA team
  - **Stakeholders**: End users, system admins, security team
  - **Scope & Constraints**: 
    - Web and mobile apps
    - GDPR compliance required
    - Integration with existing user database
  - **Complexity Assessment**: Medium complexity (authentication + authorization)
  - **Structure & Sections**:
    - Executive Summary
    - Functional Requirements (login, logout, password reset, MFA)
    - Non-Functional Requirements (security, performance, scalability)
    - User Stories with acceptance criteria
    - Technical Architecture
    - API Specifications
  - **Timeline & Dependencies**: Backend API first, then frontend integration
- **Decision Point**: "Proceed to Build?"

#### Step 3: Build Mode - Document Generation (2.5 minutes)
**[Recording needed - Content framework ready]**
- **Build Mode Execution**: Full PRD generation using advanced AI workflows
- **Generated PRD Sections**:
  - **Executive Summary**: Clear project overview and business value
  - **Functional Requirements**:
    - FR-001: User login with email/password
    - FR-002: Password strength validation
    - FR-003: Password reset functionality
    - FR-004: Multi-factor authentication (optional)
    - FR-005: Session management
  - **Non-Functional Requirements**:
    - Performance: Login response < 200ms
    - Security: Password hashing with bcrypt
    - Scalability: Support 10,000 concurrent users
    - Compliance: GDPR data protection standards
  - **User Stories with Acceptance Criteria**:
    - "As a user, I want to log in securely so I can access my account"
    - Acceptance criteria with detailed scenarios
