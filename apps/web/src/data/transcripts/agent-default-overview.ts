## Introduction

Hey, I'm Justin from Orchestrator AI. So, we're a small team that built something pretty cool. It's AI agents that act and feel like you're actually having expert teammates on your team that you can chat with anytime.

So, you know how in a small business you oftentimes have to wear, like, ten different hats through your day-to-day life? Well, these specialists are there to help you with that. Sort of like having a different specialist for each hat.

So I'm going to walk you through how this actually works and how we use it in our own business every day.

## The Problem with Generic AI

So, basically, we got tired of generic AI that always gives you some bland responses for everything. Like, say I ask ChatGPT about marketing and golf rules. It's basically the same AI, trying to wing it for both topics, even though they're vastly different.

What we built instead is more like having actual specialists on your team for each topic. So, the marketing agent, it knows marketing inside and out. The finance one, it actually understands business metrics, not just generic advice coming from a generic AI.

Each one has its own personality, its own way of working. Sort of like real people would. So, let me show you what I mean, and show you some of our already created agents, and show you an example of it working.

## Agent Library Overview

So, as you can see here, we have a laundry list of agents that have already been built. We have everything from a jokes writer, to a calendar or meetings agent. We have a blog post writer, HR assistant, all this stuff. Metrics invoice, and we have a lot that are fairly generic that almost anyone would need, or any business would use, but a lot of these can be tailored towards specific businesses too.

So, say for example, if you're a teacher, there can be an agent that teachers can use that grades papers. Or, say you are a restaurant owner, we can make an agent that will do your shift planning for you, and lay out the week shifts.

So, we're adding new ones every day, but we already have a bunch written, and a lot more to come too.

## Requirements Writer Demonstration

But anyways, let's check out our requirements writer here. So, first things first. You really want to be as specific as possible with these, because the more detail you give it off the bat, the quicker it'll get things right.

So, I copied a pre-written request for it here, so I can just paste it in and show you guys.

So, this says, "I need to create a product requirements document for a new mobile app feature that allows users to track their daily water intake. The feature should integrate with existing health apps and send reminder notifications."

So let's send that off, it'll take a little bit, it'll look at what I gave it, and then it'll think and come up with a good PRD for us that'll sort of lay out a plan to actually do this. So you can see it comes back with an overview scope, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, technical requirements, just tons and tons of stuff, that's based on a quick little prompt.

## Conversational Intelligence

And what's great about this, is that it's sort of like having an actual conversation with someone who actually knows what they're doing. You're not teaching it how to do its job, it already knows that, so you don't have to get everything perfect in one shot, you can build on what it gives you and ask for follow-ups and refinements, and it'll remember everything that you talked about, in context.

And, on top of that, what's also great here is that you can ask it questions outside of specific prompts.

So, let me ask it here just for some general advice. "What am I missing here? What edge cases should I be worried about? What would an experienced product manager tell me to think about?"

And, again, same thing. It takes what you give it, it goes off and thinks about it, and it'll come back with some advice for what an actual product manager might tell you to think about. You got missing requirements, edge cases, an idea of what an experienced product manager would think about. All this stuff that is pretty useful.

## Closing

So, that's pretty much it. We built this because we're a small business too, and we know what it's like to need expertise that you can't afford to hire full time. These agents are like having specialists on call whenever you need them. You just pick whichever one matches what you're dealing with right now.

So if you need to understand your numbers, hit up the finance agent. Got marketing questions? There's an agent for that. And if there's not one, we can build one for you.

So, give it a shot, see what you think. We're here if you have questions. We're just a small team trying to help other small teams get stuff done better.`;
