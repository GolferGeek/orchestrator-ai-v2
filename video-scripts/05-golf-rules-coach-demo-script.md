## SCRIPT

### Opening Hook (0:00 - 0:45)
**[SCREEN: Orchestrator AI main interface]**

> "So this one's a bit different - it's our Golf Rules Expert. I built this because I got tired of arguing about rules on the course, or worse, realizing I applied the wrong rule and basically cheated without meaning to. You know how there's always that one person who thinks they know the rules but actually doesn't?"

**[ACTION: Navigate to Golf Rules Expert agent]**

> "Well, this agent actually does know the rules. Like, all of them. USGA, R&A, the weird edge cases, everything. Let me show you how it handles some situations that come up way more often than you'd think."

### Agent Introduction & Rules Authority (0:45 - 1:30)
**[SCREEN: Golf Rules Expert agent interface]**

> "The Golf Rules Expert isn't just a general AI - it's trained specifically on official USGA and R&A Rules of Golf. It understands the nuances of rule interpretations, knows the latest rule changes, and can provide the exact rule citations for any situation."

**[ACTION: Show agent capabilities or description]**

> "What sets this agent apart is its ability to handle complex scenarios where multiple rules might apply, explain the reasoning behind rulings, and provide step-by-step procedures for proper relief."

**[ACTION: Start conversation with agent]**

> "Let me demonstrate with real golf situations that every player encounters."

### Scenario 1: Water Hazard/Penalty Area (1:30 - 3:00)
**[SCREEN: Chat interface with Golf Rules Expert]**

> "Let's start with one of the most common situations - a ball in a penalty area, formerly known as a water hazard."

**[TYPE IN CHAT:]**
```
My ball just went into the pond on the 15th hole - it's marked with red stakes. I can see my ball sitting there underwater about 5 feet from the edge. What are my options here? Do I have to take a penalty stroke, and if so, where can I drop?
```

**[ACTION: Send message and observe response]**

> "Notice how the agent immediately identifies this as a red penalty area and provides ALL available relief options, not just the most common one."

**[SCREEN: Show agent's comprehensive response with rule citations]**

> "The agent gives us four options: play as it lies, stroke and distance, back-on-the-line relief, and lateral relief. But more importantly, it explains the penalty for each option and cites Rule 17.1 specifically."

**[ACTION: Highlight specific rule citations and procedures]**

> "See how it provides step-by-step procedures? For lateral relief: 'Drop within two club-lengths of the point where the ball last crossed the edge of the penalty area, no nearer the hole, one penalty stroke.' That's exactly what you need to know on the course."

### Scenario 2: Unplayable Ball Complex Situation (3:00 - 4:30)
**[SCREEN: Continue conversation with complex scenario]**

> "Now let's test the agent with a more complex situation that involves multiple rule considerations."

**[TYPE IN CHAT:]**
```
Okay, this is a weird one. My ball is stuck in a tree about 8 feet up - I can see it's definitely my ball but there's no way I can hit it from there. The tree is also hanging over the cart path. If I declare this unplayable, where exactly can I drop? Does the cart path change anything about my options?
```

**[ACTION: Send message and show detailed analysis]**

> "This is where the agent's expertise really shines. It's not just dealing with an unplayable ball - it's considering the interaction between unplayable ball relief and cart path relief."

**[SCREEN: Show agent breaking down the complex scenario]**

> "The agent explains that you first take relief for the unplayable ball under Rule 19.2, THEN if your relief area includes the cart path, you can take additional free relief under Rule 16.1. It understands the sequence of rule applications."

**[ACTION: Highlight the step-by-step procedure]**

> "Notice the clear procedure: 1) Declare unplayable, 2) Choose relief option, 3) If drop area includes cart path, take additional relief. Plus it cites both Rule 19.2 and Rule 16.1 with the specific penalty - one stroke for unplayable, no additional penalty for cart path relief."

### Scenario 3: Equipment and Competition Rules (4:30 - 6:00)
**[SCREEN: Show equipment-related query]**

> "Equipment regulations can be tricky. Let's see how the agent handles equipment and competition questions."

**[TYPE IN CHAT:]**
```
During a tournament round, I realized my driver has a small crack in the face near the sweet spot. The crack happened during normal play on hole 3, and I'm now on hole 7. Can I continue using this club? Can I replace it? What are the rules for damaged equipment during competition?
```

**[ACTION: Send message and show equipment rules expertise]**

> "Equipment rules during competition are complex and have specific procedures. Watch how the agent handles this."

**[SCREEN: Show detailed equipment ruling]**

> "The agent correctly identifies this as Rule 4.1 - damaged equipment during round. Since the damage occurred during normal play, you can continue using the club OR replace it under specific conditions."

**[ACTION: Highlight competition-specific procedures]**

> "But here's the key - it explains the competition restrictions: you cannot delay play to replace the club, you cannot borrow from another player in your group, and you must follow the 'damaged equipment' procedure, not the 'conforming clubs' rule."

### Scenario 4: Putting Green Complications (6:00 - 7:30)
**[SCREEN: Show putting green scenario]**

> "Putting green rules have specific nuances. Let's test a common but confusing situation."

**[TYPE IN CHAT:]**
```
On the putting green, my ball marker was accidentally moved by my playing partner when she was lining up her putt. She moved my marker about 2 inches closer to the hole. We both noticed it. What's the correct procedure to fix this situation?
```

**[ACTION: Send message and show putting green expertise]**

> "This involves both accidental movement and proper procedure for replacing ball markers. The agent needs to know multiple rule interactions."

**[SCREEN: Show comprehensive putting green ruling]**

> "Perfect response. The agent explains that under Rule 13.1d, when a ball marker is accidentally moved by another player, there's no penalty to anyone, and the marker must be replaced to its original position."

**[ACTION: Highlight no-penalty situations and proper procedures]**

> "Notice how it emphasizes 'no penalty' and provides the exact replacement procedure. It also references Rule 14.1 about marking and lifting balls. This is the kind of precision you need during tournament play."

### Scenario 5: Unusual Circumstances (7:30 - 8:30)
**[SCREEN: Show unusual scenario]**

> "Finally, let's test the agent with an unusual situation that requires rules interpretation."

**[TYPE IN CHAT:]**
```
My ball came to rest against a rake in a bunker. When I moved the rake, my ball rolled further into the bunker and is now in a worse lie. A spectator said I should replace the ball, but my playing partner says I have to play it where it rolled. Who's right and what rule applies?
```

**[ACTION: Send message and show interpretation]**

> "This tests the agent's understanding of movable obstructions in bunkers and accidental movement of balls."

**[SCREEN: Show detailed rule interpretation]**

> "Excellent. The agent correctly identifies the rake as a movable obstruction under Rule 15.2, explains that moving it is allowed without penalty, and that if the ball moves when the obstruction is removed, the ball must be replaced to its original spot."

**[ACTION: Highlight rule citation and reasoning]**

> "Rule 15.2a covers this exactly. The agent explains both the procedure and the reasoning - the ball movement was directly caused by removing the obstruction, so replacement is required, not just accepted."

### Closing & Competitive Advantage (8:30 - 9:00)
**[SCREEN: Show agent overview or return to main interface]**

> "So yeah, this one's pretty niche, but if you play golf regularly, you know how valuable this is. No more arguing on the course, no more feeling embarrassed because you don't know a rule, no more accidentally breaking rules you didn't even know existed."

**[ACTION: Show call-to-action or agent selection]**

> "It's like having a rules official in your pocket. And honestly, it's kind of fun to finally understand what all those confusing rules actually mean."

**[SCREEN: End on agent interface or platform overview]**

> "If you're a golfer and you want to actually know what you're doing out there, give this a try. Ask it about whatever golf situation has been bugging you."
