## SCRIPT

### Opening Hook (0:00 - 0:30)
**[SCREEN: Landing page or main dashboard]**

> "Hey there! I'm Justin from Orchestrator AI. So we're a small team that built something pretty cool - AI agents that actually feel like having expert teammates you can chat with anytime. You know how in a small business you wear like 10 different hats? Well, these agents are like having specialists for each of those hats."

**[ACTION: Navigate to agent selection]**

> "I'm going to walk you through how this actually works in real life - no marketing fluff, just showing you exactly how we use these agents in our own business every day."

### Core Concept Introduction (0:30 - 1:30)
**[SCREEN: Agent gallery or selection interface]**

> "So here's the thing - we got tired of generic AI that gives you the same bland responses for everything. Like, if I ask ChatGPT about marketing AND ask it about golf rules, it's basically the same AI trying to wing it on both topics."

**[ACTION: Hover over different agent cards, showing their descriptions]**

> "What we built instead is more like having actual specialists on your team. This marketing agent? It knows marketing inside and out. The finance one? It actually understands business metrics, not just generic advice."

**[ACTION: Click on an agent to show detailed description]**

> "Each one has its own personality and way of working, just like real people. Let me show you what I mean by jumping into an actual conversation."

### Practical Demonstration: Starting a Conversation (1:30 - 3:00)
**[SCREEN: Select a general agent like Requirements Writer]**

> "Alright, let's actually use one. I'll pick our Requirements Writer because honestly, documentation is something every small business struggles with, right?"

**[ACTION: Click to start conversation]**

> "Now here's the trick - don't be vague. Like, don't just say 'help me write something.' The more specific you are, the better it gets. So I'll say:"

**[TYPE IN CHAT BOX:]**
```
I need to create a Product Requirements Document for a new mobile app feature that allows users to track their daily water intake. The feature should integrate with existing health apps and send reminder notifications.
```

**[ACTION: Send message and wait for response]**

> "See what just happened? It immediately started asking smart follow-up questions - stuff about user personas, technical constraints, success metrics. That's because this agent actually knows how to gather requirements, not just write generic docs."

**[SCREEN: Show agent's response with follow-up questions]**

> "This is the magic - it's like having a conversation with someone who actually knows what they're doing. You're not teaching it how to do its job."

### Advanced Tips & Workflows (3:00 - 5:00)
**[SCREEN: Continue the conversation or switch to another agent]**

> "Okay, so here are a few things I've learned from using these agents in our actual business:"

**[ACTION: Type follow-up responses to show iteration]**

> "First - treat it like a real conversation. Don't try to get everything perfect in one shot. Build on what it gives you, ask follow-ups, refine things. It remembers everything you've talked about."

**[SCREEN: Show how conversation builds context]**

> "Now here's something cool about how the chat actually works - you've got different response modes depending on what you need. Like, if I just need a quick answer, there's immediate mode where it fires back responses right away. But if I'm working on something complex, I can switch to real-time mode and actually watch it think through the problem step by step."

**[ACTION: Show toggling between chat modes or demonstrate the difference]**

> "The real-time mode is wild - you can literally see it building the response as it goes. Super helpful when you're working on big projects because you can jump in and course-correct if it's heading in the wrong direction. Instead of waiting for a full response and then saying 'no, that's not what I meant,' you can guide it while it's working."

**[SCREEN: Demonstrate real-time response building]**

> "And honestly? Sometimes I just leave it in real-time mode because it feels more like having an actual conversation with a teammate. You know how when you're brainstorming with someone, ideas build on each other? It's like that."

> "Second - if you need something in a specific format, just ask. Like:"

**[TYPE EXAMPLE:]**
```
Can you format this as a technical spec with API endpoints and database stuff? I need to send this to our developer.
```

**[ACTION: Show agent adapting format]**

> "And third - this is my favorite part - ask it for advice. These agents know their stuff, so don't just use them for grunt work:"

**[TYPE EXAMPLE:]**
```
What am I missing here? What edge cases should I be worried about? What would an experienced product manager tell me to think about?
```

**[SCREEN: Show expert-level insights from agent]**

### Multi-Agent Workflows (5:00 - 6:00)
**[SCREEN: Navigate to a different agent or show agent switching]**

> "Now here's where it gets really cool. For big projects, you can bounce between different agents. Like, start with the Requirements Writer to figure out what you're building, then hop over to our Finance agent to see if the numbers make sense, then maybe hit up the Marketing agent to figure out how to actually sell it."

**[ACTION: Show quick example of switching between agents]**

> "Each agent remembers what you're working on, but brings their own expertise to it. It's like having a whole team, but they actually talk to each other."

**[SCREEN: Show different agents with related project context]**

> "Here's a cool trick - you can reference your other conversations. Like, you can tell the Finance agent 'Hey, based on that PRD I just made with the Requirements Writer...' and it knows what you're talking about."

### Closing & Next Steps (6:00 - 6:30)
**[SCREEN: Return to main dashboard or agent selection]**

> "So that's basically it. We built this because we're a small business too, and we know what it's like to need expertise you can't afford to hire full-time. These agents are like having specialists on call whenever you need them."

**[ACTION: Hover over different agent options]**

> "Just pick whichever one matches what you're dealing with right now. Need to understand your numbers? Hit up the Finance agent. Got marketing questions? There's an agent for that. Heck, if you just need a laugh during a stressful day, we've got the Jokes agent."

> "Give it a shot and see what you think. We're here if you have questions - just a small team trying to help other small teams get stuff done better."

**[SCREEN: End on agent selection interface or call-to-action]**
