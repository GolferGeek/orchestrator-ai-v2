## 1. Policy Statement

Regular and punctual attendance is essential to Acme Corporation's success. Our employees depend on each other, and our clients depend on all of us. When employees are absent or late, it affects team productivity, project timelines, and customer service.

This policy establishes clear expectations for attendance and punctuality, procedures for reporting absences, and consequences for excessive absenteeism or tardiness.

---

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all Acme Corporation employees unless superseded by a collective bargaining agreement, individual employment contract, or specific departmental policy. Exempt and non-exempt employees are subject to the same attendance expectations.

---

## 3. Work Schedules

### 3.1 Standard Hours

**Standard Business Hours:** 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday

**Core Hours:** 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM
- All employees are expected to be available during core hours
- Meetings should be scheduled during core hours when possible

### 3.2 Flexible Work Arrangements

Acme Corporation supports flexible work arrangements when business needs allow:

**Flextime:** Employees may adjust start and end times with manager approval, provided they work their scheduled hours and are available during core hours.

**Compressed Workweek:** With manager approval, some positions may work four 10-hour days.

**Remote Work:** See the Remote Work Policy for details on working from home.

### 3.3 Shift Schedules

Some departments operate outside standard hours. Employees in these departments follow schedules established by their managers. Common alternative schedules include:

- **Customer Support:** 7:00 AM - 10:00 PM, 7 days a week (rotating shifts)
- **Data Center Operations:** 24/7 coverage (three 8-hour shifts)
- **Security:** 24/7 coverage (rotating 12-hour shifts)

---

## 4. Attendance Expectations

### 4.1 Reporting to Work

Employees are expected to:
- Arrive on time for scheduled work hours
- Be ready to begin work at the scheduled start time
- Remain at work for the entire scheduled shift, except for authorized breaks
- Work required overtime when requested with reasonable notice

### 4.2 Definitions

**Absence:** Not reporting to work as scheduled for any portion of the workday.

**Tardy/Late:** Arriving after the scheduled start time or returning late from breaks.

**Early Departure:** Leaving before the end of the scheduled shift without authorization.

**No Call/No Show:** Failing to report to work and failing to notify the supervisor.

---

## 5. Absence Notification Procedures

### 5.1 How to Report an Absence

Employees who will be absent must:

1. **Notify their supervisor directly** by phone call or text message
2. **Provide notice** at least one hour before the scheduled start time
3. **State the reason** for the absence and expected return date
4. **Contact HR** if the absence will exceed 3 consecutive days

**Important:**
- Email notification alone is not sufficient
- Having someone else call on your behalf is only acceptable in emergencies
- Voicemail is acceptable only if the supervisor is unavailable and a return call is made

### 5.2 Extended Absences

For absences exceeding 3 consecutive workdays:
- Contact HR at hr@acmecorp.com or ext. 4000
- Medical documentation may be required
- FMLA or other leave may apply
- Daily call-ins may be waived once leave is approved

### 5.3 Documenting Absences

Supervisors document all absences in Workday. Required information includes:
- Date and duration of absence
- Reason for absence
- Whether advance notice was provided
- Any documentation received

---

## 6. Types of Absences

### 6.1 Excused Absences

The following are considered excused absences when properly reported:

**Pre-Approved:**
- Paid Time Off (PTO) approved in advance
- Company holidays
- Jury duty
- Military leave
- Approved leaves of absence

**With Appropriate Notice:**
- Personal illness or injury
- Medical appointments (when possible, schedule outside work hours)
- Family member illness requiring care
- Bereavement (see Bereavement Policy)
- Religious observances
- Emergencies (severe weather, car accidents, etc.)

### 6.2 Unexcused Absences

Absences are considered unexcused when:
- No notification is provided to the supervisor
- Notification is provided after the start of the shift (without valid reason)
- The reason for absence is not approved or documented
- Required documentation is not provided
- The employee does not respond to follow-up communication

### 6.3 Protected Absences

Certain absences are protected by law and do not count toward attendance tracking:
- FMLA-qualifying leave
- ADA-related absences for medical appointments or treatment
- Workers' compensation leave
- Military leave under USERRA
- Time off for voting (where required by law)
- Domestic violence leave (where required by law)

---

## 7. Tardiness

### 7.1 Definition

An employee is considered tardy when arriving:
- More than 5 minutes after the scheduled start time
- Late from scheduled breaks (breaks exceeding allowed time)

### 7.2 Notification

If you will be late:
- Call or text your supervisor before your start time
- Provide an estimated arrival time
- Document in Workday upon arrival

### 7.3 Patterns

Occasional tardiness due to traffic or unforeseen circumstances is understandable. However, patterns of tardiness are unacceptable and will be addressed:
- Consistent Monday morning tardiness
- Regular late returns from lunch
- Frequent "just a few minutes late" arrivals

---

## 8. No Call/No Show

### 8.1 Definition

A no call/no show occurs when an employee fails to report to work and fails to notify their supervisor.

### 8.2 Consequences

No call/no show is a serious offense:
- First occurrence: Written warning
- Second occurrence: Final written warning or suspension
- Third occurrence: Termination

Three consecutive days of no call/no show may be considered job abandonment and result in automatic termination.

### 8.3 Emergency Exceptions

If an emergency prevented notification (hospitalization, accident, etc.), employees should contact HR as soon as possible with documentation. Legitimate emergencies will be excused.

---

## 9. Time Tracking

### 9.1 Non-Exempt Employees

Non-exempt employees must accurately record all time worked:
- Clock in at the start of the shift
- Clock out for unpaid meal breaks
- Clock in when returning from breaks
- Clock out at the end of the shift

**Rounding:** Time is rounded to the nearest quarter hour (7 minutes).

**Falsification:** Falsifying time records (including clocking in/out for others) is grounds for immediate termination.

### 9.2 Exempt Employees

Exempt employees are not required to track hours but must:
- Report absences of half-day or more in Workday
- Be available during core hours
- Meet job responsibilities regardless of hours worked

---

## 10. Attendance Tracking System

### 10.1 Point System

Unexcused absences and tardiness are tracked using a point system:

| Occurrence | Points |
|------------|--------|
| Unexcused absence | 1 point |
| Tardy (up to 1 hour) | 0.5 points |
| Tardy (over 1 hour) | 1 point |
| Early departure | 0.5 points |
| No call/no show | 3 points |

### 10.2 Rolling Period

Points are tracked over a rolling 12-month period. Points expire 12 months after the occurrence date.

### 10.3 Thresholds and Consequences

| Points | Action |
|--------|--------|
| 3 points | Verbal warning (documented) |
| 5 points | Written warning |
| 7 points | Final written warning |
| 9 points | Termination |

Management reserves the right to deviate from progressive discipline based on circumstances.

- Absences following denied PTO requests
- Absences when specific projects or tasks are due

### 11.2 Addressing Patterns

---

- 1-2 days off: 1 week advance notice
- 3-5 days off: 2 weeks advance notice

Managers approve requests based on business needs and workload. Popular vacation times may have blackout dates.
