## A Message from Our CEO

Dear Colleagues,

At Acme Corporation, our reputation is our most valuable asset. For nearly four decades, we have built trust with our clients, partners, and communities through ethical business practices and a commitment to doing the right thing.

This Code of Conduct outlines the principles and standards that guide our behavior. It applies to everyone at Acme Corporation—from our Board of Directors to our newest team members. No matter your role, you are responsible for upholding these standards every day.

If you ever find yourself unsure about the right course of action, ask yourself:
- Is it legal?
- Is it consistent with our values?
- Would I be comfortable if it appeared in the news?
- Would I be proud to tell my family about it?

If the answer to any of these questions is "no," don't do it. When in doubt, speak up. Ask your manager, HR, Legal, or use our confidential Ethics Hotline.

Thank you for your commitment to integrity.

**James Morrison**
Chief Executive Officer
