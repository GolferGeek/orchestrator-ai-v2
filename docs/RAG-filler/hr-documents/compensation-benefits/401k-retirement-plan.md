## Company Match

### Matching Formula
Acme Corporation matches your contributions as follows:

| Your Contribution | Company Match | Total Contribution |
|------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 0% | 0% | 0% |
| 1% | 1% | 2% |
| 2% | 2% | 4% |
| 3% | 3% | 6% |
| 4% | 4% | 8% |
| 5% | 4.5% | 9.5% |
| 6% | 5% | 11% |
| 7%+ | 5% | 12%+ |

**Match Formula:** 100% match on first 4% + 50% match on next 2%

### Match Details
- Match is deposited each pay period
- Match is always pre-tax (even on Roth contributions)
- Match invested in same funds as your contributions (unless you choose otherwise)
- Match counts toward annual addition limit

### Maximizing the Match
To get the full company match, contribute at least 6% of your salary.

**Example (salary $100,000):**
| If You Contribute | Company Match | Your Total Annual |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 4% ($4,000) | 4% ($4,000) | $8,000 |
| 6% ($6,000) | 5% ($5,000) | $11,000 |
| 10% ($10,000) | 5% ($5,000) | $15,000 |

---

## Vesting

### What Is Vesting?
Vesting determines how much of the company match you own. Your own contributions are always 100% vested.

### Vesting Schedule
| Years of Service | Vested Percentage |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Less than 1 year | 0% |
| 1 year | 25% |
| 2 years | 50% |
| 3 years | 75% |
| 4+ years | 100% |

### How Vesting Works
- Years of service begin on your hire date
- Must complete 1,000 hours in a year for a year of service
- Unvested amounts forfeited if you leave before fully vested
- Forfeited amounts used to reduce future company contributions

**Example:**
- Company match in your account: $20,000
- Years of service: 2 years
- Vesting percentage: 50%
- If you leave now: You keep $10,000 (and your own contributions)
- If you stay 2 more years: You keep $20,000 (100% vested)

Loans reduce your retirement savings growth and must be repaid.

## Fees

### Plan Administrative Fees

| Loan Origination | $75 |
| Loan Maintenance | $25/year |

### Understanding Expense Ratios
Expense ratios are deducted from fund returns (not separately charged):
