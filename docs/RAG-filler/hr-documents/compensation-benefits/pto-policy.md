## 1. Policy Statement

Acme Corporation provides paid time off (PTO) to support work-life balance and employee well-being. PTO may be used for vacation, personal time, illness, or any other purpose. This policy describes PTO eligibility, accrual, usage, and administration.

---

## 2. Eligibility

### Full-Time Employees
Employees regularly scheduled to work 40 hours per week are eligible for full PTO accrual.

### Part-Time Employees
Employees regularly scheduled to work 20-39 hours per week accrue PTO on a prorated basis.

### Temporary and Contract Employees
Not eligible for PTO unless required by state law.

### Accrual Start Date
PTO begins accruing on your first day of employment. Accrued PTO is available for use after completing 90 days of employment (except for illness, which is available immediately).

---

## 3. PTO Accrual

### Accrual Schedule

| Years of Service | Annual PTO (Full-Time) | Accrual Per Pay Period | Maximum Balance |
|-----------------|------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| 0-2 years | 15 days (120 hours) | 4.62 hours | 160 hours |
| 3-5 years | 20 days (160 hours) | 6.15 hours | 200 hours |
| 6-10 years | 25 days (200 hours) | 7.69 hours | 240 hours |
| 11+ years | 30 days (240 hours) | 9.23 hours | 280 hours |

### How Accrual Works
- PTO accrues each pay period (bi-weekly)
- Accrual is based on hours paid (regular hours, PTO, holidays)
- Unpaid leave does not accrue PTO
- New tier begins on the anniversary of hire date

### Accrual Cap
Once you reach your maximum balance, accrual stops until you use PTO. Plan your time off to avoid losing accrual. The company does not pay for lost accrual due to reaching the cap.

### Service Date for Accrual
Your service date is your original hire date. If you were rehired:
- Within 12 months: Prior service counts
- After 12 months: Service date resets (subject to state law)
