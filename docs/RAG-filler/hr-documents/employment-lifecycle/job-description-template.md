## Guidelines for Writing Job Descriptions

### Title

**Do:**
- Use clear, standard titles (Software Engineer, not Code Ninja)
- Include level indicators (Senior, Lead, Manager)
- Be searchable (what would candidates look for?)

**Don't:**
- Use internal jargon
- Create overly creative titles
- Use gendered language

### Position Summary

- Keep it to 2-3 sentences
- Explain the "why" behind the role
- Make it compelling to candidates
- Highlight impact and opportunities

### Responsibilities

**Do:**
- Start with action verbs
- Be specific and measurable where possible
- List most important duties first
- Include collaborative aspects
- Cover range of activities

**Don't:**
- Use vague language ("assist with various tasks")
- List every possible task
- Make it a wall of text

**Good Examples:**
- "Design and implement RESTful APIs using Python and FastAPI"
- "Partner with Product Management to define technical requirements"
- "Mentor junior engineers through code reviews and pair programming"

**Bad Examples:**
- "Handle various technical tasks"
- "Work on stuff"
- "Help with projects"

### Qualifications

**Required vs. Preferred:**
- Required: Absolute must-haves for day-one success
- Preferred: Nice-to-haves that enhance candidacy

**Be Thoughtful About Requirements:**
- Don't require degrees when experience suffices
- Don't require excessive years of experience
- Consider if requirements exclude qualified candidates
- Avoid "culture fit" language (leads to homogeneity)

**Years of Experience:**
- Entry: 0-2 years
- Mid-level: 2-5 years
- Senior: 5-8 years
- Lead/Principal: 8+ years

### Inclusive Language

**Avoid:**
- Gendered terms (he/she, manning, manpower)
- Age-biased terms (energetic, digital native, seasoned)
- Ability-biased language (must be able to see)
- Culturally specific terms

**Use:**
- They/them when referring to the candidate
- Neutral descriptions of requirements
- Focus on capabilities, not characteristics

### Legal Compliance

**Include:**
- EEO statement
- Salary range (where required by law)
- Physical requirements (if bona fide)

**Avoid:**
- Questions about protected characteristics
- Requirements unrelated to job duties
- Discriminatory preferences

### Salary Transparency

Many states require salary ranges in job postings:
- California
- Colorado
- Connecticut
- New York (NYC)
- Washington

Even where not required, transparency is best practice.
