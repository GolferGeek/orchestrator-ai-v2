An individual or entity for whom the firm previously provided legal services and:

- The consultation was solicited or unsolicited
- A fee was charged or paid

**Material Limitation:**
A conflict exists when there is significant risk that representation will be materially limited by:

Matters are substantially related if they involve:
- The same transaction or legal dispute
