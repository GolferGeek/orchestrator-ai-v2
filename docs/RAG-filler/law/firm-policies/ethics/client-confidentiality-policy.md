### Section 1.4: Ethical Foundation

#### 1.4.1 Rule 1.6 - Confidentiality of Information

The fundamental rule governing lawyer confidentiality provides:

> A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to the representation of a client unless the client gives informed consent, the disclosure is impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation, or the disclosure is permitted by the exceptions in the rule.

**Key Principles:**
- Protection extends to ALL information relating to representation
- Protection applies regardless of the source of information
- Protection applies regardless of whether information would be harmful if disclosed
- The duty continues after the attorney-client relationship ends

#### 1.4.2 Distinction from Attorney-Client Privilege

**Confidentiality (Rule 1.6):**
- Ethical duty owed by lawyer to client
- Applies to ALL information relating to representation
- Cannot be compelled to disclose (but not as robust as privilege)
- Broader in scope than privilege

**Attorney-Client Privilege:**
- Evidentiary rule
- Applies to confidential communications for purpose of legal advice
- Can only be waived by client (or through inadvertence)
- Narrower but provides stronger protection

**Work Product Doctrine:**
- Protects materials prepared in anticipation of litigation
- Attorney work product (mental impressions) receives stronger protection
- Can be overcome by showing substantial need and undue hardship

### Section 1.5: Duration of Confidentiality Obligations

#### 1.5.1 Beginning of the Duty

The confidentiality duty attaches when:

1. **Initial Contact**: From the first communication with a prospective client, even if representation is never undertaken (Rule 1.18)
2. **Consultation**: During any consultation, whether in person, by phone, or electronic
3. **Referral**: When receiving information from another attorney about a potential referral
4. **Conflicts Check**: When conducting conflict checks that involve client information

#### 1.5.2 Continuation of the Duty

The duty continues:

1. Throughout the representation
2. After the representation concludes
3. After the attorney leaves the firm
4. After the client's death (with limited exceptions)
5. Indefinitely, unless an exception applies

#### 1.5.3 Succession of the Duty

Upon attorney departure or firm dissolution:

1. Departing attorneys retain confidentiality duties to former clients
2. Remaining firm attorneys retain confidentiality duties
3. Files must be transferred securely
4. New counsel must be informed of confidentiality obligations
