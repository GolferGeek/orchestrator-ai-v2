## SECTION 1: CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSES

### Clause CL-100: Standard Mutual NDA Provision

**Risk Level**: Green
**Usage Context**: Standard mutual confidentiality in commercial agreements

#### Version A: Comprehensive (Preferred)

```
CONFIDENTIALITY

1. Definition. "Confidential Information" means any non-public information
disclosed by either Party ("Disclosing Party") to the other Party ("Receiving
Party") that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be
understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and
circumstances of disclosure. Confidential Information includes, without
limitation: business plans, financial data, technical information, customer
lists, pricing information, trade secrets, software code, product designs,
marketing strategies, and the terms of this Agreement.

2. Exclusions. Confidential Information does not include information that:
(a) is or becomes publicly available through no fault of the Receiving Party;
(b) was rightfully in the Receiving Party's possession before disclosure;
(c) is rightfully obtained from a third party without restriction; or
(d) is independently developed without use of Confidential Information.

3. Obligations. The Receiving Party shall: (a) use Confidential Information
solely for purposes of this Agreement; (b) protect Confidential Information
using at least the same degree of care used for its own confidential
information, but no less than reasonable care; (c) limit disclosure to
employees, contractors, and agents with a need to know who are bound by
confidentiality obligations; and (d) not disclose to third parties without
prior written consent.

4. Required Disclosure. If compelled by law to disclose Confidential
Information, the Receiving Party shall provide prompt notice (to the extent
permitted), cooperate with efforts to obtain protective treatment, and
disclose only the minimum required.

5. Duration. These confidentiality obligations shall survive for five (5)
years from disclosure, except for trade secrets which shall be protected
for as long as they remain trade secrets under applicable law.

6. Return/Destruction. Upon termination or request, the Receiving Party
shall promptly return or certify destruction of all Confidential Information.
```

#### Version B: Abbreviated (For Low-Risk Situations)

```
CONFIDENTIALITY. Each Party shall maintain the confidentiality of the other
Party's non-public information ("Confidential Information") disclosed in
connection with this Agreement. Neither Party shall use Confidential
Information except for purposes of this Agreement or disclose it to third
parties without prior written consent. These obligations shall not apply
to information that is publicly available, rightfully obtained from third
parties, or independently developed. Confidentiality obligations survive
for three (3) years following termination.
```

**Negotiation Notes**:
- Duration is commonly negotiated (3-7 years typical range)
- Consider carve-outs for affiliates and professional advisors
- "Reasonable care" standard is market; resist "highest degree of care"
- Trade secret carve-out is important and should not be shortened

---

### Clause CL-101: One-Way (Discloser Favorable) NDA Provision

**Risk Level**: Yellow
**Usage Context**: When client is primarily disclosing sensitive information

```
CONFIDENTIALITY OF DISCLOSER INFORMATION

1. Confidential Information. Recipient acknowledges that in connection with
this Agreement, Discloser may disclose certain proprietary and confidential
information, including but not limited to: [SPECIFY CATEGORIES]. All such
information, whether disclosed in writing, orally, electronically, or by
any other means, shall be deemed "Confidential Information."

2. Non-Disclosure. Recipient shall not disclose, publish, or disseminate
Confidential Information to any third party without Discloser's prior
written consent.

3. Non-Use. Recipient shall not use Confidential Information for any purpose
other than evaluating or engaging in a business relationship with Discloser.

4. Protection Standard. Recipient shall protect Confidential Information
using the highest degree of care Recipient uses to protect its own most
sensitive confidential information, but in no event less than a reasonable
degree of care.

5. No Reverse Engineering. Recipient shall not reverse engineer, disassemble,
or decompile any Confidential Information or any products or prototypes
containing Confidential Information.

6. Ownership. All Confidential Information remains the property of Discloser.
No license or other rights to Confidential Information are granted by this
Agreement except the limited right to review the information for the
stated purpose.

7. Injunctive Relief. Recipient acknowledges that unauthorized disclosure
would cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages would be inadequate,
and Discloser shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief without posting
bond.

8. Survival. These obligations shall survive termination and continue
indefinitely until the Confidential Information no longer qualifies for
protection.
```

**Negotiation Notes**:
- "Highest degree of care" is aggressive; expect pushback
- Indefinite survival is aggressive; may need to compromise to 7-10 years
- Injunctive relief without bond may not be enforceable in all jurisdictions

---

### Clause CL-102: Residuals Clause

**Risk Level**: Red (Partner Review Required)
**Usage Context**: Technology/consulting agreements where retained knowledge is valuable

```
RESIDUALS. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, either
Party shall be free to use for any purpose the Residuals resulting from
access to or work with the Confidential Information of the other Party.
"Residuals" means information in non-tangible form that is retained in the
unaided memory of a Party's employees who have had access to Confidential
Information, including ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques contained
therein. A Party shall not have any obligation to limit or restrict the
assignment of such employees or to pay royalties for any work that such
employees may perform based on Residuals. However, this Section shall not
be deemed to grant either Party a license under the other Party's
copyrights, patents, or other intellectual property rights.
```

**Negotiation Notes**:
- Clients often push back strongly on residuals clauses
- Consider limiting to "unaided memory" only
- May need to exclude specific categories of highly sensitive information
- Patent and copyright carve-outs are essential

---

## SECTION 2: INDEMNIFICATION CLAUSES

### Clause CL-200: Mutual Indemnification (Balanced)

**Risk Level**: Green
**Usage Context**: Standard commercial agreements with balanced risk allocation

```
INDEMNIFICATION

1. By Service Provider. Service Provider shall indemnify, defend, and hold
harmless Client and its officers, directors, employees, agents, successors,
and assigns ("Client Indemnitees") from and against any and all claims,
damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees)
("Losses") arising from or related to: (a) Service Provider's breach of
this Agreement; (b) Service Provider's negligence or willful misconduct;
(c) any claim that Deliverables infringe any third-party intellectual
property rights; or (d) any violation of applicable law by Service Provider.

2. By Client. Client shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Service
Provider and its officers, directors, employees, agents, successors, and
assigns ("Provider Indemnitees") from and against any Losses arising from
or related to: (a) Client's breach of this Agreement; (b) Client's
negligence or willful misconduct; (c) any claim that Client Materials
infringe any third-party rights; or (d) any violation of applicable law
by Client.

3. Procedure. The indemnified Party shall: (a) promptly notify the
indemnifying Party of any claim; (b) allow the indemnifying Party to control
the defense and settlement (provided no settlement shall require any
admission or payment by the indemnified Party without consent); and
(c) reasonably cooperate with the defense. Failure to provide prompt notice
shall not relieve the indemnifying Party except to the extent actually
prejudiced.

4. Exclusive Remedy for IP Claims. The indemnification in Section 1(c)
states the indemnifying Party's entire liability and the indemnified Party's
exclusive remedy for intellectual property infringement claims.
```

**Negotiation Notes**:
- "Defend" obligation is broader than "indemnify" alone
- Control of defense is a key negotiating point
- Consider adding cooperation cost reimbursement
- IP indemnity exclusivity protects against double recovery

---

### Clause CL-201: Enhanced IP Indemnification with Remediation

**Risk Level**: Yellow
**Usage Context**: Software/technology agreements requiring IP protection

```
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INDEMNIFICATION AND REMEDIATION

1. Indemnification. Service Provider shall indemnify, defend, and hold
harmless Client from any claim, suit, or proceeding ("Claim") alleging
that the Deliverables, or Client's use thereof in accordance with this
Agreement, infringe, misappropriate, or violate any patent, copyright,
trademark, trade secret, or other intellectual property right of any
third party.

2. Exceptions. Service Provider shall have no obligation under this Section
to the extent a Claim arises from: (a) modifications to Deliverables made
by Client or at Client's direction without Service Provider's approval;
(b) combination of Deliverables with other products, services, or technology
not provided by Service Provider, where the Claim would not have arisen
but for such combination; (c) Client's failure to implement updates
provided by Service Provider to avoid infringement; (d) Client Materials;
or (e) use of Deliverables other than as permitted under this Agreement.

3. Remediation. If any Deliverable becomes, or in Service Provider's opinion
is likely to become, the subject of an infringement Claim, Service Provider
may, at its expense and option: (a) procure for Client the right to continue
using the Deliverable; (b) replace or modify the Deliverable to make it
non-infringing while maintaining substantially equivalent functionality; or
(c) if neither (a) nor (b) is commercially reasonable, terminate the
affected license and refund to Client the fees paid for such Deliverable,
prorated over a [three (3)] year useful life from the date of delivery.

4. Procedure. Client shall: (a) provide prompt written notice of any Claim;
(b) grant Service Provider sole control of the defense and settlement
(provided no settlement shall impose liability on Client or require any
admission without Client's consent); (c) provide reasonable assistance
at Service Provider's expense; and (d) not make any admission or settlement
without Service Provider's prior written consent.

5. Entire Liability. THIS SECTION STATES SERVICE PROVIDER'S ENTIRE LIABILITY
AND CLIENT'S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OF INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT.
```

**Negotiation Notes**:
- Exceptions are important - resist over-broad language
- Three-year useful life for refund is negotiable (3-5 years typical)
- Consider whether "likely to become" trigger is acceptable
- Ensure non-infringing replacement must be "substantially equivalent"

---

### Clause CL-202: Indemnification Carve-Outs

**Risk Level**: Yellow
**Usage Context**: Add to indemnification provisions to limit scope

#### Carve-Out A: Proportionate Fault

```
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying Party's obligations shall
be reduced in proportion to the degree to which the indemnified Party's
acts or omissions contributed to the Losses.
```

#### Carve-Out B: Cap on Indemnification

```
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying Party's aggregate liability
under this Section shall not exceed [AMOUNT / FORMULA], except with respect
to (a) indemnification for third-party intellectual property claims,
(b) indemnification arising from gross negligence or willful misconduct,
or (c) indemnification for bodily injury or death.
```

#### Carve-Out C: Insurance-Based Cap

```
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying Party's aggregate liability
under this Section shall not exceed the amounts available under its
applicable insurance policies, provided the indemnifying Party maintains
at all times the insurance coverages required under this Agreement.
```

---

## SECTION 3: LIMITATION OF LIABILITY CLAUSES

### Clause CL-300: Standard Limitation of Liability

**Risk Level**: Green
**Usage Context**: Most commercial agreements

```
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

1. Exclusion of Consequential Damages. EXCEPT FOR BREACHES OF
CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS, INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS, OR GROSS
NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE
FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST
REVENUES, LOST SAVINGS, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF USE, OR COST OF SUBSTITUTE
SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION OR THE THEORY OF LIABILITY,
EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

2. Cap on Liability. EXCEPT FOR BREACHES OF CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS,
INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS, OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT,
EACH PARTY'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT
EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) THE TOTAL FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY CLIENT UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM, OR
(B) [DOLLAR AMOUNT].

3. Basis of Bargain. THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION ARE A
FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND SHALL APPLY
REGARDLESS OF THE SUCCESS OR EFFECTIVENESS OF OTHER REMEDIES.
```

**Negotiation Notes**:
- Exclusion carve-outs are critical - list is negotiable
- 12-month look-back is standard; resist shorter periods
- Floor amount provides protection for low-value contracts
- All-caps required in many jurisdictions for enforceability

---

### Clause CL-301: Tiered Liability Cap

**Risk Level**: Yellow
**Usage Context**: Complex agreements with different risk categories

```
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

1. Exclusion of Consequential Damages. [Standard language per CL-300.1]

2. Tiered Liability Caps. Subject to Section 3 below, each Party's total
aggregate liability under this Agreement shall be limited as follows:

   (a) General Cap: For all claims except those specified below, liability
   shall not exceed the Fees paid or payable during the twelve (12) months
   preceding the claim.

   (b) Data Breach Cap: For claims arising from a breach of data security
   or privacy obligations, liability shall not exceed [TWO TIMES] the Fees
   paid or payable during the twelve (12) months preceding the claim, or
   [DOLLAR AMOUNT], whichever is greater.

   (c) IP Infringement Cap: For claims arising from intellectual property
   infringement, liability shall not exceed [THREE TIMES] the Fees paid or
   payable during the twelve (12) months preceding the claim, or [DOLLAR
   AMOUNT], whichever is greater.

3. Exclusions from Caps. The limitations in Section 2 shall not apply to:
   (a) Liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence;
   (b) Liability for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation;
   (c) Liability arising from gross negligence or willful misconduct;
   (d) Liability that cannot be limited under applicable law.

4. Aggregate Limit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall either
Party's total aggregate liability under this Agreement exceed [MAXIMUM
DOLLAR AMOUNT].
```

**Negotiation Notes**:
- Tiered structure allows risk-appropriate allocation
- Data breach multiplier is increasingly important
- Absolute cap provides ultimate protection
- Ensure exclusions are mutual

---

### Clause CL-302: Unlimited Liability Carve-Outs

**Risk Level**: Red (Partner Review Required)
**Usage Context**: When counterparty requires unlimited liability for certain claims

```
UNLIMITED LIABILITY. Notwithstanding any limitation of liability set forth
in this Agreement, there shall be no limitation on either Party's liability
for:

(a) Death or bodily injury resulting from such Party's negligence;
(b) Fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, or willful misconduct;
(c) Breach of confidentiality obligations with respect to the other Party's
    trade secrets;
(d) Infringement or misappropriation of the other Party's intellectual
    property rights;
(e) Breach of Section [X] (Data Protection/Security);
(f) Amounts owed under express indemnification obligations;
(g) Any liability that cannot be limited under applicable law.
```

**Negotiation Notes**:
- Each carve-out significantly increases risk exposure
- Trade secret breach carve-out is very broad - consider limiting
- Data protection carve-out is increasingly requested post-GDPR
- IP infringement unlimited is very aggressive

---

```
JOINT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

**Usage Context**: Where service provider needs to retain IP for other clients

```
