## What is Estate Planning?

Estate planning is the process of arranging for the management and distribution of your assets during your lifetime and after death. A comprehensive estate plan helps:

- Ensure your assets go to the people you choose
- Minimize taxes and legal fees
- Avoid family disputes
- Protect minor children
- Plan for incapacity
- Maintain privacy (avoiding probate when possible)

## Essential Estate Planning Documents

### 1. Last Will and Testament

**Purpose:** Directs how your assets are distributed after death and names a guardian for minor children.

**Key Provisions:**
- Identification of beneficiaries
- Specific bequests (particular items to particular people)
- Residuary clause (everything else)
- Executor nomination
- Guardian nomination for minor children
- Trust provisions for minors (if applicable)

**Requirements in Most States:**
- Must be in writing
- Signed by the testator (person making the will)
- Witnessed by two disinterested adults
- Some states require notarization

**What a Will Does NOT Do:**
- Control assets with beneficiary designations (life insurance, retirement accounts)
- Control jointly owned property
- Avoid probate
- Provide for incapacity planning

### 2. Revocable Living Trust

**Purpose:** Holds assets during your lifetime and distributes them after death, typically avoiding probate.

**Benefits:**
- Avoids probate (saves time and money)
- Maintains privacy (trusts are not public record)
- Provides for incapacity management
- Can be changed during your lifetime
- Immediate access for beneficiaries

**Key Components:**
- Grantor/Settlor (you, the creator)
- Trustee (manager of trust assets)
- Successor Trustee (takes over if you cannot serve)
- Beneficiaries (who receives assets)
- Trust terms (how and when distributions occur)

**Funding the Trust:**
Assets must be re-titled into the trust name to avoid probate:
- Real estate (deed)
- Bank accounts
- Investment accounts
- Business interests

**What Stays Out of the Trust:**
- Retirement accounts (IRA, 401k) – name trust as beneficiary instead
- Life insurance – name trust as beneficiary
- Vehicles (in most states)

### 3. Financial Power of Attorney

**Purpose:** Authorizes someone to handle your financial affairs if you become incapacitated.

**Types:**
- **Durable:** Remains effective even if you become incapacitated (most common)
- **Springing:** Only becomes effective upon incapacity
- **Limited:** For specific purposes or time periods

**Powers Typically Granted:**
- Banking transactions
- Real estate transactions
- Investment management
- Tax filing
- Business operations
- Government benefits
- Insurance matters

**Important Considerations:**
- Choose someone you trust completely
- Consider naming alternates
- Review and update periodically
- Some institutions require their own forms
- Can be revoked while you have capacity

### 4. Healthcare Power of Attorney / Healthcare Proxy

**Purpose:** Authorizes someone to make medical decisions if you cannot.

**Key Provisions:**
- Designation of healthcare agent
- Alternate agents
- HIPAA authorization
- Scope of authority
- Specific instructions or limitations

**When It Takes Effect:**
Typically when your physician determines you lack capacity to make medical decisions.

**Agent's Responsibilities:**
- Follow your known wishes
- Act in your best interest
- Consult with medical providers
- Access your medical records
- Make treatment decisions

### 5. Living Will / Advance Healthcare Directive

**Purpose:** States your wishes regarding end-of-life medical treatment.

**Common Provisions:**
- Life-sustaining treatment preferences
- Artificial nutrition and hydration
- Pain management
- Organ donation
- Religious or personal considerations

**When It Applies:**
- Terminal condition
- Permanent unconsciousness
- End-stage condition

**Important:** Be as specific as possible. Vague language can lead to disputes.

### 6. HIPAA Authorization

**Purpose:** Allows designated individuals to access your medical information.

**Why Needed:**
Federal privacy laws prohibit healthcare providers from sharing your information without authorization, even with family members.

**Who to Include:**
- Healthcare agents
- Spouse/partner
- Adult children
- Anyone who may need medical information

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need a trust?

A trust is beneficial if you:
- Own real estate
- Want to avoid probate
- Have privacy concerns
- Have minor children
- Have beneficiaries who shouldn't receive assets outright
- Own property in multiple states

### How often should I update my estate plan?

Review your plan:
- Every 3-5 years
- After major life events (marriage, divorce, birth, death)
- After significant changes in assets
- When moving to a new state
- After changes in tax laws

### What happens if I die without a will?

Your assets pass according to state intestacy laws, which may not match your wishes. The court appoints an administrator for your estate, and if you have minor children, the court chooses their guardian.

### Can I write my own will?

While technically possible, we strongly recommend working with an attorney. Common problems with DIY wills:
- Improper execution
- Ambiguous language
- Missing provisions
- Failure to account for all assets
- Invalid in your state

### What is probate and why should I avoid it?

Probate is the court process for validating a will and distributing assets. Reasons to avoid:
- Time (6 months to 2+ years)
- Cost (3-8% of estate value)
- Public record
- Court involvement in family matters
- Potential for disputes
