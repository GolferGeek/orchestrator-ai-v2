## Article I: Introduction to Estate Planning

### Section 1.1: What is Estate Planning?

#### 1.1.1 Definition and Purpose

Estate planning is the comprehensive process of arranging for the management, preservation, and distribution of your assets during your lifetime and after death. A well-designed estate plan:

**Primary Objectives:**
1. **Asset Distribution**: Ensures your assets transfer to your chosen beneficiaries
2. **Tax Minimization**: Reduces estate, gift, and income taxes where legally possible
3. **Family Protection**: Safeguards minor children and dependents
4. **Incapacity Planning**: Prepares for potential disability or cognitive decline
5. **Privacy Preservation**: Minimizes public disclosure of personal affairs
6. **Dispute Prevention**: Reduces family conflicts and litigation
7. **Business Continuity**: Ensures smooth transition of business interests
8. **Charitable Goals**: Facilitates philanthropic objectives

#### 1.1.2 Who Needs Estate Planning

**Everyone** needs some level of estate planning. Common misconceptions:

| Misconception | Reality |
|--------------|---------|
| "I don't have enough assets" | Even modest estates need distribution plans |
| "I'm too young" | Accidents and illness affect all ages |
| "Everything goes to my spouse" | Not always true under state law |
| "I already have beneficiary designations" | These may conflict with overall goals |
| "A will is enough" | Many assets pass outside of wills |

#### 1.1.3 Consequences of No Estate Plan

Without proper planning:
- State intestacy laws determine asset distribution
- Courts appoint guardians for minor children

- Expresses final wishes

#### 2.1.2 Key Components

**A. Identification and Revocation**

```
Standard Opening Language:

- Statement of testamentary capacity
```

**B. Appointment of Fiduciaries**

| Role | Function | Selection Criteria |
|------|----------|-------------------|

| Alternate Executor | Serves if primary cannot | Same criteria |
| Guardian | Raises minor children | Parenting values, stability |
| Alternate Guardian | Serves if primary cannot | Same criteria |
| Trustee | Manages trust assets | Financial acumen, longevity |

**C. Specific Bequests**

Types of specific gifts:
- **Specific Bequest**: Particular item to particular person
- **General Bequest**: Fixed dollar amount
- **Demonstrative Bequest**: From specific source
- **Residuary Bequest**: Everything remaining

**D. Residuary Clause**

Disposes of:
- Assets not specifically mentioned

|-------|---------------------|
| Louisiana | Notarization required |
| Vermont | Three witnesses required |
| Pennsylvania | No witness signatures required |
| Some States | Holographic (handwritten) wills valid |

#### 2.1.4 What a Will Does NOT Control

Assets passing outside of will:
- Joint tenancy property (survivorship)
- Beneficiary designations (life insurance, retirement accounts)
- Pay-on-death (POD) accounts
- Transfer-on-death (TOD) registrations
- Property in revocable trusts
- Property held in tenancy by the entirety

### Section 2.2: Revocable Living Trust

#### 2.2.1 Trust Fundamentals

**Definition**: A revocable living trust is a legal entity created during your lifetime to hold and manage assets.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Created during lifetime (inter vivos)
- Fully revocable and amendable
- Grantor serves as initial trustee
- Avoids probate for funded assets
- Becomes irrevocable at death

**Trust Participants:**

| Role | Also Called | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Grantor | Settlor, Trustor | Creates and funds the trust |
| Trustee | | Manages trust assets |
| Successor Trustee | | Takes over when grantor cannot serve |
| Beneficiary | | Receives trust benefits |
| Remainder Beneficiary | | Receives assets at grantor's death |

#### 2.2.2 Advantages of Revocable Trusts

**Probate Avoidance:**
- No court supervision of distribution
- Immediate asset access for beneficiaries
- Faster administration (months vs. years)
- Lower costs (no court fees, reduced attorney fees)
- Multi-state property consolidated

**Privacy:**
- Trust not filed with court
- Asset information remains private
- Distribution terms confidential
- Beneficiaries not publicly disclosed

**Incapacity Planning:**
- Successor trustee steps in seamlessly
- No court-appointed conservator needed
- Management continues without interruption
- Medical privacy maintained

**Flexibility:**
- Revoke or amend at any time
- Change beneficiaries as desired
- Adjust trust terms as circumstances change
- Combine with other planning tools

#### 2.2.3 Trust Funding Requirements

**CRITICAL**: An unfunded trust provides NO probate avoidance.

**Assets to Transfer INTO Trust:**

| Asset Type | Transfer Method | Notes |
|------------|-----------------|-------|
| Real Estate | Deed | Quitclaim or warranty deed |
| Bank Accounts | New account or re-title | Check with bank |
| Brokerage Accounts | Re-registration | Standard process |
| Business Interests | Assignment | LLC interests, stock |
| Tangible Personal Property | Assignment | Furniture, jewelry, art |
| Vehicles | Varies by state | Some states recommend against |

**Assets to Keep OUTSIDE Trust (Generally):**

| Asset Type | Approach | Reason |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Retirement Accounts (IRA, 401k) | Name trust as beneficiary | Tax consequences of transfer |
| Life Insurance | Name trust as beneficiary | No ownership transfer needed |
| Vehicles | TOD or POD where available | Title complexity |
| Checking Account | Small balance for daily use | Convenience |
| S Corporation Stock | Consult tax advisor | S election concerns |

#### 2.2.4 Pour-Over Will

- Healthcare power of attorney (for medical decisions if incapacitated)

Without these documents, your family may need expensive court proceedings to make decisions for you.

| Cost | Lower initial | Higher initial |
| Ongoing maintenance | None | Funding required |
| Multi-state property | Separate probate each state | One administration |

#### 5.1.3 Do I need a trust if I have a small estate?

Consider a trust if you:
- Own real estate
