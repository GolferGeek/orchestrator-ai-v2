## Article III: Taking Depositions

### Section 3.1: Opening Procedures

#### 3.1.1 Preliminary Instructions

Standard opening instructions to witness:

1. **Oath**: Witness will be placed under oath
2. **Verbal Responses**: "Yes" or "No" not head nods
3. **Complete Answers**: Let me finish question before answering
4. **Understanding**: Ask for clarification if you don't understand
5. **Guessing**: Don't guess; "I don't know" is acceptable
6. **Documents**: You may review documents if needed
7. **Breaks**: We can take breaks; don't answer pending questions
8. **Objections**: Counsel may object; you still must answer unless instructed otherwise
9. **Corrections**: You can correct answers if you remember differently

#### 3.1.2 Standard Opening Script

```
Good morning. My name is [NAME] and I represent [CLIENT] in this matter.
You have been sworn to tell the truth. Do you understand that you are
under oath and that your testimony has the same force as if you were
testifying in court?

I'm going to ask you questions and you're going to give me verbal answers
that the court reporter can take down. Please say "yes" or "no" rather
than nodding your head.

If you don't understand a question, please tell me and I'll try to rephrase
it. If you answer a question, I'll assume you understood it.

Please don't guess. If you don't know or don't remember, that's a perfectly
acceptable answer.

You may take a break whenever you need one; just let me know. However, if
there's a question pending, please answer it before we take the break.

Your attorney may make objections. Unless your attorney instructs you not
to answer, please go ahead and answer the question.

At the end of this deposition, you will have an opportunity to review the
transcript and make corrections. However, please give your best, most
accurate testimony today.

Do you have any questions before we begin?
```
