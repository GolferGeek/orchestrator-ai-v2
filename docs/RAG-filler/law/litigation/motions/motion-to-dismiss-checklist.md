## Strategic Considerations

### When to File 12(b)(6) Motion

**File When:**
- Complaint clearly fails to state a claim
- Dispositive legal issue exists
- Narrowing claims would significantly change case
- Early resolution benefits client

**Consider Not Filing When:**
- Amendment would cure defects
- Discovery needed to develop defense
- Motion would only delay inevitable answer
- Cost outweighs benefit

### Dismissal With vs. Without Prejudice

**Without Prejudice:**
- Plaintiff can amend and re-file
- Appropriate when defects are curable
- Often required on first dismissal

**With Prejudice:**
- Bars re-filing
- Appropriate when amendment would be futile
- After multiple failed amendments
- Statute of limitations has run

### Converting to Summary Judgment

If matters outside the pleadings are considered, motion converts to summary judgment (Rule 12(d)):
- All parties must have opportunity to submit evidence
- Court must give notice of conversion
- Consider whether conversion is strategic

## After Filing

### Monitoring Deadlines

- [ ] Calendar opposition deadline
- [ ] Calendar reply deadline
- [ ] Monitor for hearing notice
- [ ] Track any court orders

### Responding to Opposition

- [ ] Determine if reply necessary
- [ ] Draft reply brief
- [ ] File reply by deadline

### Hearing Preparation

- [ ] Prepare oral argument outline
- [ ] Anticipate questions
- [ ] Review recent cases from this judge
- [ ] Coordinate with co-counsel
- [ ] Confirm hearing time/location

## Post-Ruling Actions

### If Motion Granted

- [ ] Review order for scope (with/without prejudice)
- [ ] Assess whether appeal appropriate
- [ ] If dismissed without prejudice, calendar any deadlines to amend
- [ ] Prepare for potential amended complaint

### If Motion Denied

- [ ] File answer within 14 days
- [ ] Consider interlocutory appeal (rarely available)
- [ ] Preserve issues for appeal
- [ ] Reassess case strategy

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Missing the deadline** – Calendar immediately upon service
2. **Arguing facts** – 12(b)(6) tests legal sufficiency, not facts
3. **Ignoring local rules** – Page limits, meet and confer, etc.
4. **Over-briefing** – Be concise and focused
5. **Failing to address all claims** – Motion should cover each count
6. **Missing reply deadline** – Failure to reply waives arguments
7. **Attaching exhibits on 12(b)(6)** – Generally converts to summary judgment
