## Article I: Motion to Dismiss Overview

### Section 1.1: Purpose and Function

#### 1.1.1 What is a Motion to Dismiss?

A Motion to Dismiss challenges the legal sufficiency of a complaint without addressing the factual merits of the case. It is a powerful defensive tool that can:

- Eliminate claims early in litigation
- Narrow the scope of remaining claims
- Establish favorable legal precedent
- Preserve issues for appeal
- Reduce discovery burden and costs
- Test the strength of plaintiff's legal theories

#### 1.1.2 Strategic Considerations

**When to File:**

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Clear jurisdictional defect | File immediately |
| Complaint lacks essential element | Strong candidate |
| Dispositive legal issue | Excellent opportunity |
| Statute of limitations expired | Must file |
| Improper service | File or waive |
| Some claims viable, some not | Partial motion |

**When to Consider Not Filing:**

| Situation | Reasoning |
|-----------|-----------|
| Amendment would cure defects | Delays inevitable |
| Discovery needed for defense | May reveal weaknesses |
| Cost outweighs benefit | Resource consideration |
| Judicial hostility to such motions | Low success rate |
| Better addressed at summary judgment | Stronger record |

#### 1.1.3 Timing Considerations

**Federal Court Timeline:**

| Event | Deadline | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Complaint served (personal in US) | Day 0 | Starts clock |
| Response deadline | Day 21 | Answer OR motion to dismiss |
| Waiver of service signed | Day 60 | Extended deadline |
| Motion to Dismiss filed | Before answer deadline | Tolls answer deadline |
| Answer due (if MTD denied) | 14 days after ruling | Automatic extension |

**State Court Timeline (Varies):**

| Jurisdiction Type | Typical Response Period |
|------------------|------------------------|
| State court (typical) | 20-30 days |
| Small claims | 10-20 days |
| Federal court | 21 days (or 60 with waiver) |

---

## Article II: Rule 12(b) Grounds for Dismissal

### Section 2.1: Subject Matter Jurisdiction - Rule 12(b)(1)

#### 2.1.1 Overview

A challenge to the court's power to hear the case. Unlike other 12(b) defenses, this can be raised at any time, including on appeal.

#### 2.1.2 Types of 12(b)(1) Challenges

**Facial Attack:**
- Challenges the sufficiency of allegations
- Court assumes complaint's factual allegations are true
- Only looks at the face of the complaint

**Factual Attack:**
- Challenges the truth of jurisdictional facts
- Court may consider evidence outside the complaint
- No presumption that allegations are true
- Burden on plaintiff to prove jurisdiction

#### 2.1.3 Federal Question Jurisdiction Analysis

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Does the complaint arise under federal law?
- [ ] Is the federal issue apparent on the face of the complaint?
- [ ] Does the well-pleaded complaint rule apply?
- [ ] Is there complete preemption?
- [ ] Are there embedded federal issues in state law claims?

**Key Questions:**

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| Federal statute creates cause of action | Jurisdiction exists |
| Federal law is essential element | May support jurisdiction |
| Federal defense only | No federal question jurisdiction |
| State law claim with federal issue | Grable analysis required |

**Grable Factors (Embedded Federal Issues):**
1. Federal issue necessarily raised
2. Actually disputed
3. Substantial
4. Federal court can entertain without disturbing balance

#### 2.1.4 Diversity Jurisdiction Analysis

**Complete Diversity Checklist:**
- [ ] All plaintiffs diverse from all defendants?
- [ ] Citizenship properly determined for each party?
- [ ] Amount in controversy exceeds $75,000?
- [ ] No forum defendant rule violation (removal)?

**Citizenship Determination:**

| Entity Type | Citizenship Rule |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Individual | State of domicile |
| Corporation | State of incorporation AND principal place of business |
| LLC/Partnership | Citizenship of ALL members |
| Unincorporated Association | Citizenship of ALL members |
| Trusts | Depends on type; often trustee's citizenship |

**Amount in Controversy:**

| Scenario | Analysis |
|----------|----------|
| Single claim | Face value of claim |
| Multiple claims against same defendant | Aggregate allowed |
| Multiple plaintiffs | Generally cannot aggregate |
| Injunctive relief | Value to plaintiff or cost to defendant |
| Class actions | May aggregate under CAFA |

#### 2.1.5 Standing Analysis

**Constitutional Requirements (Lujan):**

- [ ] **Injury in Fact**: Concrete, particularized, actual or imminent
- [ ] **Causation**: Fairly traceable to defendant's conduct
- [ ] **Redressability**: Likely to be redressed by favorable decision

**Standing Checklist:**

| Element | Questions to Ask |
|---------|-----------------|
| Injury | Is harm concrete? Is it particularized to plaintiff? Is it actual or imminent (not speculative)? |
| Causation | Did defendant's conduct cause the injury? Is the connection direct or attenuated? |
| Redressability | Will the requested relief remedy the injury? Is relief within court's power? |

**Prudential Standing Considerations:**
- Zone of interests test
- Third-party standing limitations
- Generalized grievances

### Section 2.2: Personal Jurisdiction - Rule 12(b)(2)

#### 2.2.1 Overview

Challenges the court's power over the defendant. Unlike subject matter jurisdiction, can be waived if not timely raised.

#### 2.2.2 General Jurisdiction Analysis

**Applies When:**
- Defendant is "at home" in the forum state
- Any claim can be brought, regardless of connection to forum

**Checklist for Corporations:**
- [ ] State of incorporation?

- [ ] Exceptional circumstances making forum essentially "home"?

**Checklist for Individuals:**
- [ ] State of domicile?
- [ ] Continuous and systematic contacts?

**Key Cases:**

| Case | Holding |
|------|---------|
| *Goodyear v. Brown* (2011) | Foreign subsidiaries not "at home" in NC |
| *Daimler AG v. Bauman* (2014) | "At home" test; contacts must be so substantial as to make forum comparable to home |
| *BNSF Railway v. Tyrrell* (2017) | "At home" test strictly applied |

#### 2.2.3 Specific Jurisdiction Analysis

**Three-Part Test:**
1. Purposeful availment/direction toward forum

3. Exercise of jurisdiction is reasonable

**Purposeful Availment Checklist:**
- [ ] Did defendant deliberately engage with the forum?
- [ ] Did defendant target the forum market?
- [ ] Did defendant seek economic benefit from forum?

| *Ford Motor Co. v. Montana Eighth Judicial* (2021) | "Relates to" relaxed; no strict causation |
| *Mallory v. Norfolk Southern* (2023) | Consent by registration may suffice |

#### 2.2.4 Long-Arm Statute Analysis

**Two-Step Analysis:**
1. Does state long-arm statute authorize jurisdiction?
2. Does exercise comport with due process?

**Common Long-Arm Provisions:**

| Provision | Typical Coverage |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Transaction of business | Any business in state |
| Tortious act | Act or injury in state |
| Property ownership | Real property in state |
| Domestic relations | Marriage, divorce in state |

## Article III: Drafting the Motion

### Section 3.1: Required Components

#### 3.1.1 Caption and Formal Requirements

**Caption Elements:**
- [ ] Court name (full, proper)
- [ ] Case number
- [ ] Plaintiff names (or et al. if numerous)
- [ ] Defendant names (moving party)
- [ ] Document title: "Defendant's Motion to Dismiss"

**Notice of Motion (Some Jurisdictions):**
- [ ] Date and time of hearing (if required)
- [ ] Location of hearing
- [ ] Relief requested

#### 3.1.2 Introduction

**Content (1 paragraph):**
- Identify moving defendant(s)
- State the motion type
- Identify Rule 12(b) grounds
- Briefly state why dismissal warranted
- State relief requested

**Example:**
> Defendant ABC Corporation respectfully moves to dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The Complaint fails to allege facts plausibly establishing that Defendant breached any duty owed to Plaintiff or that any alleged breach caused Plaintiff's claimed damages. For the reasons set forth below, the Complaint should be dismissed with prejudice.

#### 3.1.3 Statement of Facts

**Guidelines:**
- Draw facts from the complaint
- Accept well-pleaded facts as true (for 12(b)(6))
- Present facts in light most favorable to plaintiff
- Do NOT include facts outside complaint (generally)
- Highlight gaps and deficiencies
- Be accurate and fair

#### 3.1.4 Legal Standard

**12(b)(6) Standard:**
> A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint. To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. *Ashcroft v. Iqbal*, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). A claim is facially plausible when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. *Id.* The court must accept all well-pleaded facts as true but is not required to accept legal conclusions couched as factual allegations. *Id.*

**12(b)(1) Standard:**
> A motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) may be either facial or factual. A facial attack challenges the sufficiency of the pleading itself; a factual attack goes beyond the allegations and challenges the facts upon which jurisdiction depends. When resolving a factual attack, the court may consider evidence outside the pleadings without converting the motion to one for summary judgment. The plaintiff bears the burden of proving that jurisdiction exists.

#### 3.1.5 Argument Section

**Organization:**
- Address each ground separately
- Use clear headings and subheadings
- Start with strongest arguments
- Apply law to facts methodically
- Anticipate counterarguments
- Cite controlling authority

**Argument Outline Example (12(b)(6)):**

```
I. PLAINTIFF FAILS TO STATE A CLAIM FOR NEGLIGENCE
   A. Plaintiff Fails to Allege a Duty Owed by Defendant
   B. Even If Duty Existed, Plaintiff Fails to Allege Breach
   C. Plaintiff's Causation Allegations Are Conclusory

II. PLAINTIFF FAILS TO STATE A CLAIM FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT
    A. No Contract Existed Between the Parties
    B. The Alleged Contract Lacks Essential Terms
    C. Plaintiff Fails to Allege Performance or Excuse

III. AMENDMENT WOULD BE FUTILE
```

#### 3.1.6 Conclusion

**Content:**
- Summarize relief requested
- Specify: dismissal with or without prejudice
- Request oral argument (if desired)
- Request attorneys' fees (if applicable)

**Example:**
> For the foregoing reasons, Defendant respectfully requests that the Court grant this Motion and dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint with prejudice. In the alternative, Defendant requests dismissal without prejudice. Defendant requests oral argument on this Motion.
