# Prediction System Redesign - High-Level PRD

**Date:** January 8, 2026
**Status:** Draft
**Author:** Architecture Discussion

---

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive redesign of the prediction system that introduces a multi-tier signal processing pipeline, configurable AI analysts with personality-based perspectives, multi-LLM evaluation, human-in-the-loop learning, and full prediction explainability. The system supports multiple domains (stocks, crypto, elections, polymarket) with domain-agnostic terminology and user-configurable investment strategies.

---

## Key Concepts Overview

### 1. Terminology Shift: Instruments → Targets

**Problem:** "Instrument" is finance-specific and doesn't translate to elections, sports, or other prediction domains.

**Solution:** Rename to "Target" - a domain-agnostic term that works everywhere:
- Stock target: AAPL
- Election target: "2026 Georgia Senate Race"
- Polymarket target: "Will X happen by Y date?"

---

### 2. Signals → Predictors → Predictions Pipeline

**Problem:** Current system conflates raw events with predictions. No intermediate validation layer.

**Solution:** Three-stage pipeline:

| Stage | What It Is | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Signal** | Raw event from a source | "Foxconn reports 12% revenue growth" |
| **Predictor** | Validated signal that matters | Signal + AI assessment: "This is bullish for AAPL, strength 7" |
| **Prediction** | Actual forecast when enough predictors accumulate | "AAPL UP 3.5% in 5-7 days, 71% confidence" |

Signals accumulate → Some become predictors → Predictors accumulate → Threshold met → Prediction generated.

---

### 3. Six-Tier Processing Architecture

| Tier | Name | Function |
|------|------|----------|
| **Tier 1** | Signal Detection | Evaluate raw events: "Is this a thing?" |
| **Tier 2** | Predictor Management | Accumulate predictors, check thresholds |
| **Tier 3** | Prediction Generation | Generate predictions when threshold met |
| **Tier 4** | Outcome Tracking | Monitor predictions against actual prices |
| **Tier 5** | Evaluation & Learning | Score outcomes, generate learnings |
| **Tier 6** | Missed Opportunity Detection | Find moves we should have predicted |

---

### 4. Hierarchical Context System

Contexts exist at multiple levels, with inheritance and override:

```
Runner Context (global defaults)
    ↓
Domain Context (stocks, crypto, elections)
    ↓
Universe Context (user's agent/portfolio)
    ↓
Target Context (specific stock/asset)
    ↓
Analyst Context (individual AI personality)
```

Each level can define rules for each tier. Lower levels inherit from and can override higher levels.

---

### 5. AI Analysts (Personalities)

**Problem:** One-size-fits-all AI evaluation misses nuanced perspectives.

**Solution:** Multiple AI "analysts" with different perspectives evaluate each decision:

- **Base Analyst** - Balanced, objective evaluation
- **Technical Tina** - Chart patterns, indicators, price action
- **Fundamental Fred** - Earnings, valuations, cash flow
- **Supply Chain Steve** - Target-specific specialist (e.g., AAPL supply chain)
- **Conservative Carl** - High threshold, cautious
- **Contrarian Chris** - Fades consensus, looks for overreactions

Analysts are defined at any level (runner, domain, universe, target) and inherited downward.

---

### 6. Multi-LLM Tier Evaluation

**Problem:** Single LLM may have blind spots or biases.

**Solution:** Run evaluations through multiple LLM tiers in parallel:

| Tier | Models | Cost | Use Case |
|------|--------|------|----------|
| **Gold** | Opus 4.5, GPT-4o | $$$ | Complex analysis, high-stakes |
| **Silver** | Sonnet, GPT-4o-mini | $$ | Standard evaluation |
| **Bronze** | Ollama, Llama 3 | $ | High-volume screening |

Users see color-coded results showing where LLMs agree/disagree. Disagreement itself is valuable signal. Users can enable/disable tiers per processing tier per target.

---

### 7. Asynchronous Human-in-the-Loop

**Problem:** Traditional HITL requires interrupt/checkpoint/resume complexity.

**Solution:** Async review queue - system doesn't stop, humans review when available:

- Signals with confidence 0.4-0.7 go to review queue
- Human approves/rejects/modifies whenever they can
- Response moves item to appropriate pool + updates learnings
- No blocking, no state management, no timeouts

---

### 8. Unified Learning System

**Problem:** Learnings need to go to different places (target, analyst, domain, etc.).

**Solution:** Single learning system that can update any context level:

- AI suggests learnings from evaluations and missed opportunities
- Human reviews and decides WHERE the learning applies
- Learning types: rules, patterns, weight adjustments, thresholds, things to avoid
- Both human-authored and AI-detected patterns tracked separately

---

### 9. Investment Strategies

**Problem:** Different users have different risk tolerances and investment philosophies.

**Solution:** Pre-built strategy templates that configure the entire system:

| Strategy | Risk | Thresholds | Analysts Boosted |
|----------|------|------------|------------------|
| **Aggressive** | High | Lower (more predictions) | Momentum, Technical |
| **Balanced** | Medium | Default | All equal |
| **Conservative** | Low | Higher (fewer, stronger) | Fundamental, Conservative |
| **Contrarian** | Medium | Custom | Contrarian, Sentiment |
| **Technical** | Medium | Custom | Technical, Chart patterns |

Users assign a strategy per universe. Strategy = pre-configured analyst weights + thresholds.

---

### 10. URL-Based Source Monitoring (Firecrawl)

**Problem:** Building custom integrations for every news source is slow and inflexible.

**Solution:** Users add URLs, system crawls them with Firecrawl:

- Any URL can be a source (news sites, blogs, Twitter, Reddit, SEC filings)
- User configures frequency (5 min to 1 hour)
- Firecrawl extracts content, AI creates signals
- Replaces most custom news tools

**Still need APIs for:** Real-time prices, technical indicators, options flow.

---

### 11. Dual-Path Signal Processing

**Problem:** Urgent signals (CEO resignation, earnings surprise) need immediate action, but most signals can batch.

**Solution:** Two processing paths:

| Path | Trigger | Speed | Process |
|------|---------|-------|---------|
| **Fast Path** | Urgent signal (confidence ≥0.90) | Seconds | Signal → Predictor → Prediction → Notify immediately |
| **Batch Path** | Normal signals | Minutes | Accumulate → Batch evaluate every 15-30 min |

Cron jobs: Crawlers run at various frequencies. Batch evaluators run every 15-30 min. Urgent signals bypass everything.

---

### 12. Prediction Explainability

**Problem:** Users can't understand why a prediction was made.

**Solution:** Full transparency - click any prediction to see everything:

- All signals that became predictors
- Signals considered but rejected (and why)
- Each analyst's individual assessment
- Each LLM tier's assessment
- Learnings that were applied
- Threshold evaluation details
- Complete timeline

Stored as a snapshot at prediction time.

---

### 13. Missed Opportunity Analysis

**Problem:** We miss moves and don't learn why.

**Solution:** Retroactive research when we miss:

1. Detect significant moves we didn't predict
2. AI researches what actually caused the move (web search)
3. Identify source gaps ("The Information broke this story - we don't monitor them")
4. Review signals we had but didn't act on
5. Reconstruct "what we should have done"
6. Generate learnings and tool/source suggestions

Creates a tool wishlist showing which new sources would have helped.

---

### 14. Aggregation Strategies

**Problem:** Multiple analysts and LLMs produce multiple opinions. How to combine?

**Solution:** Configurable aggregation per tier:

| Tier | Recommended Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| Signal → Predictor | Weighted majority (>50% weighted "yes") |
| Predictor strength | Weighted average |
| Prediction generation | Weighted ensemble with disagreement flag |
| Evaluation | Score both ensemble AND individuals |
| Missed detection | ANY analyst would have caught → learning opportunity |

## Open Questions

1. **Cross-target signals** - Signals affecting multiple targets (Fed announcements) will currently be crawled once per source but create signals for each applicable target. For sources spanning multiple universes, the same content may be crawled multiple times. Consider deduplication at the content level if this becomes a performance issue.

2. **Strategy backtesting** - Deferred. Backtesting is difficult with news-based signals since historical news context is hard to reconstruct. Price-based backtesting is possible but less valuable since news/sources are our primary differentiator.

---

## Resolved Decisions

### 1. User Guidance for Learning

Users need clear guidance on:
- **Adding URLs**: Wizard-style flow with examples, test-crawl before saving
- **Creating Analysts**: Templates for common perspectives, guided prompts for perspective/instructions
- **Effective Learning**: Tutorial on when to add learnings at which level (target vs universe vs domain)

The key insight: **Learnings replace context files**. Instead of editing markdown files, users add learnings through the UI at the appropriate scope level. This is more accessible and auditable.

### 2. Paywalled Source Authentication

Store encrypted credentials in the database:

```sql
ALTER TABLE prediction_sources ADD COLUMN auth_config JSONB;
-- {
--   "type": "basic" | "cookie" | "api_key" | "oauth",
--   "credentials_encrypted": "...",  -- Encrypted blob
--   "credential_hint": "username: j***@email.com"  -- For UI display
-- }
```

Encryption approach:
- Encrypt credentials at rest using application-level encryption (AES-256)
- Decrypt only when passing to Firecrawl
- Store a hint (masked) for user reference
- Support different auth types: Basic auth, cookies, API keys

### 3. LLM Cost Tracking

Already supported through our LLM service. Implementation:
- Track tokens and cost per analyst assessment
- Store in `prediction_analyst_assessments` table (already has `tokens_used`, `cost` columns)
- Aggregate and display:
  - Cost per prediction
  - Cost per day/week/month
  - Cost by LLM tier (Gold vs Silver vs Bronze)
  - Cost by universe/target

Dashboard widget:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ LLM Usage (January)                     │
│                                         │
│ 🟡 Gold:    $12.40 (142 calls)         │
│ ⚪ Silver:  $4.20 (891 calls)          │
│ 🟤 Bronze: $0.00 (2,847 calls)         │
│                                         │
│ Total: $16.60                          │
│ Avg per prediction: $0.42              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
