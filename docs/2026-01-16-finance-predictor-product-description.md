## What Is This?

Imagine having a team of expert financial analysts working around the clock, reading every piece of news, analyzing market signals, and making predictions about where stocks and crypto are headed—all without you lifting a finger.

That's what our AI-Powered Stock & Crypto Predictor does.

It continuously monitors financial news, detects market-moving signals, and generates predictions about price movements for stocks like Apple and Tesla, and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

## Part 1: What You Get As A User

### Real Predictions, Real Tracking

The system generates actual predictions with:
- **Direction**: Is the price going up (bullish) or down (bearish)?
- **Target Price**: Where do we think it's heading?
- **Timeframe**: When do we expect this to happen?
- **Confidence Level**: How sure are we about this prediction?

Every prediction is tracked against actual market outcomes. You can see exactly how accurate the system has been—no hiding from the results.

### Your Personal $1 Million Portfolio

When you sign up, you get a simulated portfolio starting with **$1,000,000**. As the system makes predictions:
- You can choose to follow predictions and "invest" from your portfolio
- Track your positions (long or short)
- Watch your profit and loss in real-time
- See your win rate and overall performance

This isn't real money—it's a powerful way to see how the predictions would perform if you acted on them, without risking a dime.

### Multiple Asset Classes

The system covers both traditional and digital assets:
- **Stocks**: Major equities like AAPL, TSLA, NVDA, etc.
- **Crypto**: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies

Each "universe" (stocks vs. crypto) can have its own configuration, news sources, and prediction strategies optimized for that asset class.

### Dashboard At A Glance

Your dashboard shows you:
- Active predictions and their current status
- Your portfolio performance
- Recent signals detected
- System accuracy metrics
- Analyst performance rankings

## Part 2: How It Actually Works (The Cool Technology)

### A Team of AI Analysts

Here's where it gets interesting. The system doesn't rely on a single AI making predictions. Instead, it uses a **team of AI analysts**, each with their own perspective:

- **Technical Analyst**: Focuses on chart patterns, momentum, support/resistance
- **Fundamental Analyst**: Looks at earnings, valuations, cash flow
- **Sentiment Analyst**: Reads the mood of the market from news and social signals
- **Macro Analyst**: Considers interest rates, economic indicators, sector rotation

Each analyst has a "personality" defined by their instructions and perspective. When making a prediction, they each weigh in, and the system combines their views through ensemble voting.

### Multi-Tier AI Models

Not all AI models are created equal. The system uses a tiered approach:

- **Gold Tier (Claude Opus 4.5)**: The most sophisticated model, highest confidence weight
- **Silver Tier (Claude Sonnet 4)**: Balanced performance and cost
- **Bronze Tier (Claude Haiku)**: Fast analysis for high-volume scanning

When analysts need to make important calls, they can escalate to higher-tier models. For routine scanning, they use faster models. This balances quality with efficiency.

### The 5-Stage Prediction Pipeline

Every prediction goes through a rigorous process:

1. **Source Crawling**: The system continuously monitors news feeds, RSS sources, and APIs—checking some sources every 5 minutes, others hourly
2. **Signal Detection**: AI reads each piece of content and extracts market signals (bullish/bearish/neutral) with confidence scores
3. **Predictor Generation**: Signals get synthesized into structured predictors with catalysts, theses, and timeframes
4. **Prediction Generation**: Multiple AI analysts vote on the final prediction using ensemble consensus
5. **Evaluation**: Once outcomes are known, every prediction is scored for accuracy

### Automatic Deduplication

The system is smart enough to know when two news articles are saying the same thing. Using content hashing and fuzzy matching, it filters out duplicate signals so the same news doesn't artificially inflate a prediction's confidence.

### Complete Traceability

Every prediction can be traced back to:
- The specific news articles or data that triggered it
- Which signals were detected
- Which analysts voted which way
- What confidence each component contributed

This isn't a black box. You can see exactly why the system made each prediction.

## Part 3: The Learning System (How It Gets Smarter)

This is where things get really sophisticated. The system doesn't just make predictions—it **learns from every outcome**.

### Dual Fork Learning Model

Here's the core innovation: each AI analyst has **two parallel versions** running simultaneously, each with their own $1M portfolio to prove their worth.

**The User Fork (Your Version)**
You control this fork. You can:
- Adjust the analyst's rules, weights, and instructions
- Approve or reject suggested improvements
- Make conservative, deliberate changes based on your judgment

**The Agent Fork (AI's Version)**
The AI controls this fork. It can:
- Modify its own rules and weights autonomously
- Experiment with new approaches
- Learn aggressively from successes and failures

**The Key: You Watch What the AI Does**

Both forks run in parallel, making predictions and tracking performance. But here's the powerful part: **you can see everything the AI is doing to improve itself**.

When the Agent Fork changes a rule or adjusts a weight, you see:
- What it changed
- Why it changed it (the performance data that triggered the change)
- How the change affected subsequent predictions

If the AI discovers something that works, you can adopt it into your User Fork. If the AI makes a mistake, you learn from it without it affecting your version. It's like having an experimental lab running alongside your production system—you get the benefit of aggressive AI learning while maintaining control over what actually runs.

**Two Portfolios, Two Learning Paths**

Each fork has its own $1M portfolio. Over time, you can compare:
- Is the AI's aggressive learning outperforming your conservative approach?
- Are there patterns the AI discovered that you should adopt?
- Are there mistakes the AI keeps making that validate your more cautious strategy?

This isn't AI replacing human judgment—it's AI and human learning in parallel, with full transparency.

### The Motivation System

The Agent Fork has real consequences for its performance. Based on its $1M portfolio balance:

- **Active** (≥80% of starting balance): Full trading privileges
- **Warning** (60-80%): Reduced confidence in its predictions
- **Probation** (40-60%): Limited to smaller positions
- **Suspended** (<40%): Paper trading only until it recovers

This creates genuine "skin in the game" for the AI—poor performance has consequences.

### Learning Queues

The system maintains two important queues:

**Review Queue (Human-in-the-Loop)**
When the AI detects a signal but isn't confident enough (40-70% confidence), it puts it in the review queue for a human to approve, reject, or modify. This is where human judgment improves the system.

**Learning Queue (AI Suggestions)**
After evaluating predictions, the system generates improvement suggestions:
- "We should weight sentiment signals higher for crypto"
- "This news source has been consistently misleading"
- "Our timing predictions are too aggressive"

Humans can review and promote these learnings into the active configuration.

### Complete Version History & Rollback

Every change to every analyst is versioned:
- What changed
- When it changed
- Why it changed (performance context)
- Who approved it (human or agent)

If a learning turns out to be wrong, you can **roll back** to any previous version. The system preserves full history—nothing is ever lost.

### Learning Exchanges Between Forks

The system tracks when learnings flow between your fork and the AI's fork:

**AI Proposes to You:**
The Agent Fork discovers a pattern and you see it in your dashboard:
> "I've noticed tech stocks respond better to sentiment signals on Mondays. Here's the evidence from 30 predictions: 73% accuracy vs. 61% on other days."

You can:
- **Adopt it**: Add the rule to your User Fork
- **Reject it**: Note why you disagree
- **Watch it**: Let the AI keep testing while you observe

**You Teach the AI:**
If you discover something through your own analysis, you can push it to the Agent Fork and watch how it performs with the AI's more aggressive trading style.

Every exchange is logged with outcomes, creating a rich history of what works and what doesn't—and who discovered it first.

### Missed Opportunity Detection

The system doesn't just evaluate predictions it made—it also looks for predictions it **should have made**:

- "AAPL moved 5% yesterday and we didn't predict it"
- "There were 3 news articles that morning we could have caught"
- "Suggested improvement: Add this RSS feed as a source"

This proactive analysis helps the system get better at catching opportunities.

## Part 4: The Testing System (Proving It Works)

### Isolated Test Environment

All testing happens in complete isolation from production:
- Test targets use a `T_` prefix (e.g., `T_AAPL`)
- Test data is flagged so it never pollutes real metrics
- You can run experiments without affecting the live system

### Test Lab Dashboard

The Test Lab lets you:
- **Create Test Scenarios**: Define specific market conditions to test
- **Generate Synthetic Articles**: Create fake news to see how the system responds
- **Create Price Data**: Simulate historical or hypothetical price movements
- **Mirror Real Targets**: Clone a real stock's configuration for testing
- **Run Backtests**: Replay historical scenarios to see what would have happened

### Scenario-Based Testing

Want to test how the system handles a market crash? Or an earnings surprise? Or a crypto pump?

Create a scenario, inject the test data, run the pipeline, and see the results. Compare expected vs. actual outcomes.

### Historical Replay

Take any period from the past, replay all the news and price data through the current system, and see:
- Would we have predicted correctly?
- What signals did we miss?
- How would our current configuration have performed?

## Part 5: Performance Analytics

### Accuracy Tracking

The system tracks accuracy across multiple dimensions:
- **Overall Accuracy**: What percentage of predictions were correct?
- **By Instrument**: How accurate are we on AAPL vs. BTC vs. ETH?
- **By Strategy**: Which prediction approaches work best?
- **By Analyst**: Which AI analysts are performing well?
- **By Time Period**: Are we getting better or worse over time?

### Analyst Performance Metrics

For each AI analyst, we track:
- **Solo P&L**: If only this analyst made predictions, what would the returns be?
- **Contribution P&L**: How much did they add to the ensemble?
- **Dissent Accuracy**: When they disagreed with the consensus, how often were they right?
- **Portfolio Ranking**: How do they stack up against other analysts?

### Signal Quality Metrics

Not all news sources are equal. The system tracks:
- Which sources produce high-quality signals
- Which sources have low signal-to-noise ratios
- Source reliability over time

This helps prioritize crawling and weight signals appropriately.

## Part 6: Always Running, Always Watching

The system runs automated processes 24/7:

| Process | Frequency | What It Does |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Source Crawler | 5-60 min | Checks news sources for new content |
| Signal Processor | 15 min | Analyzes crawled content for signals |
| Prediction Generator | 30 min | Creates predictions from accumulated signals |
| Outcome Tracker | 15 min | Checks if predictions resolved |
| Evaluator | Hourly | Scores resolved predictions |
| Missed Opportunity Scanner | 4 hours | Finds moves we should have predicted |

You don't have to do anything. The system monitors, predicts, evaluates, and learns continuously.

## Summary

This isn't just a prediction tool—it's a **self-improving financial intelligence system** that:

1. **Predicts** stock and crypto movements using a team of AI analysts
2. **Tracks** every prediction against actual outcomes with full transparency
3. **Learns** through parallel human and AI improvement paths—you control yours, the AI controls its own, and you can watch and adopt what works
4. **Tests** new strategies in isolation before going live
5. **Runs** continuously without human intervention

The goal: build the most accurate, transparent, and continuously-improving prediction system possible—where humans and AI learn together, with the human always in the driver's seat.
