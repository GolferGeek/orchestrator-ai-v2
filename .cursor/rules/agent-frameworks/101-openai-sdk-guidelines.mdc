# OpenAI Agent SDK Guidelines

## General Principles
- Utilize the official OpenAI Python SDK for interactions with OpenAI models (GPT-3.x, GPT-4, Embeddings, etc.).
- Keep API keys secure using environment variables and never commit them.
- Handle API errors gracefully (e.g., rate limits, server errors, authentication issues).

## Client Initialization
- Initialize the OpenAI client once and reuse it where possible (e.g., using FastAPI dependency injection).
- Configure necessary parameters like API key, organization (if applicable).

## Model Usage
- **Chat Completions (`gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4`, etc.)**:
  - Structure prompts clearly with system, user, and assistant messages.
  - Use appropriate parameters like `temperature`, `max_tokens`, `top_p` based on the desired output (creative vs. factual).
  - Be mindful of token limits and context window sizes.
- **Embeddings (`text-embedding-ada-002`, etc.)**:
  - Use for semantic search, clustering, and other text similarity tasks.
  - Batch requests where possible for efficiency.
- **Function Calling**:
  - Define functions clearly with JSON schema for parameters.
  - Handle function call responses from the model and execute the corresponding local functions.

## Prompt Engineering
- Develop clear, specific, and effective prompts.
- For complex tasks, consider few-shot prompting or chain-of-thought prompting techniques.
- Iterate on prompts based on model responses.

## Streaming Responses
- For interactive applications (like chatbots), use streaming for chat completions to provide faster perceived responsiveness.

## Error Handling and Retries
- Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient API errors.
- Catch specific OpenAI exceptions (e.g., `openai.error.RateLimitError`, `openai.error.AuthenticationError`).

## Cost Management
- Be aware of the pricing for different models and API calls.
- Optimize token usage by keeping prompts concise and using `max_tokens` appropriately.
- Monitor API usage through the OpenAI dashboard.

## Versioning
- Pin the OpenAI SDK version in `requirements.txt` to ensure stable behavior.
- Be aware of potential breaking changes when upgrading the SDK.
