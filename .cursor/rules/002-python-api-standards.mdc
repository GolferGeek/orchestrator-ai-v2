# Python API Standards

## General Principles
- Follow PEP 8 for code style.
- Write clear, concise, and maintainable code.
- Embrace asynchronous programming (`async`/`await`) for I/O-bound operations.
- Use type hints for all function signatures and variables.

## FastAPI Best Practices
- Use Pydantic models for request and response validation.
- Leverage FastAPI's dependency injection system for managing resources and dependencies.
- Organize routes logically, typically by resource or functionality.
- Use `APIRouter` to group related routes and include them in the main `FastAPI` app.
- Implement proper status codes for HTTP responses (e.g., 200, 201, 400, 404, 500).
- Use `HTTPException` for standard HTTP errors.

## Route Organization
- Group related endpoints in separate Python modules (e.g., `[agent_name]/routes.py`).
- Use descriptive names for route functions.
- Keep route functions focused on handling the request and returning a response; delegate business logic to service layers or utility functions.

## Error Handling
- Implement centralized error handling using exception handlers or middleware where appropriate.
- Provide meaningful error messages to clients without exposing sensitive internal details.
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging.

## Pydantic Model Usage
- Define Pydantic models for all request bodies, query parameters, and response payloads.
- Use field validators for complex validation logic.
- Utilize response_model to serialize and validate outgoing data.

## Asynchronous Programming
- Use `async def` for all route handlers and I/O-bound operations.
- Use `await` for calling asynchronous functions.
- Be mindful of blocking calls within async functions; use `run_in_threadpool` if necessary for synchronous libraries.

## Dependency Injection
- Use FastAPI's `Depends` for injecting dependencies like database sessions, configuration, or service classes.
- Define dependencies as callable functions or classes.

## Logging
- Use the standard `logging` module.
- Configure logging levels appropriately for different environments (DEBUG in dev, INFO/WARNING in prod).
- Include relevant information in log messages, such as request IDs, timestamps, and context-specific data.

## Testing
- Write unit tests for business logic and utility functions.
- Write integration tests for API endpoints using FastAPI's `TestClient`.
- Aim for high test coverage.
- Use fixtures for setting up test data and dependencies.
