# Markdown Context Standards

## Purpose
- Markdown context files serve as the primary knowledge base for agents in the early bootstrapping phase.
- They allow for rapid prototyping and iteration before implementing more complex RAG or API integrations.

## File Location
- Agent context files are located within their respective API implementation's `markdown_context/` directory
- Each agent should have its own markdown file named `[agent_name].md` (e.g., `metrics_agent.md`) within its context directory
- Ensure that paths in test and discovery fixtures are updated when directory structures change

## Formatting Requirements
- Use standard Markdown syntax.
- Organize content logically using headings (H1, H2, H3, etc.) for structure.
- Use clear and concise language.

## Content Guidelines
- **Agent Persona/Role**: Define the agent's role, expertise, and tone.
- **Key Information**: Include core data, facts, or knowledge relevant to the agent's function.
  - For `metrics_agent`: Sample metrics, definitions, calculation methods, interpretation guidelines.
  - For `write_blog_post`: Blog post structures, style guides, SEO keywords, example opening/closing paragraphs.
- **Capabilities & Limitations**: Clearly state what the agent can and cannot do based on the provided context.
- **Example Interactions**: Provide a few examples of user queries and expected agent responses based *only* on the markdown content. This helps in understanding the agent's intended behavior.
- **Data Formatting**: For structured data (like tables or lists of items), use Markdown tables or formatted lists for easy parsing by an LLM.

## Size Limitations
- No single context file should exceed 1MB. This is a practical limit to ensure efficient processing by LLMs and to encourage focused, relevant context.

## Maintenance
- Regularly review and update context files as the project evolves.
- Ensure consistency between the agent's `agent.json` description and its markdown context capabilities.
