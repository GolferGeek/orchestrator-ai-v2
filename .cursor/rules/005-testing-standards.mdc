# Testing Standards

## General Principles
- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes.
- Tests should be reliable, readable, and maintainable.
- Aim for a balanced testing pyramid (unit, integration, E2E).
- Ensure tests can run independently and in any order.

## Running Tests and API
- Before running tests, ensure the environment is properly configured:
  - Use `npm run configure:api` to set up the API environment
  - This command will set up the necessary environment variables and configuration
- To run the actual API server:
  - Use `npm run api` to start the API server
  - This will run the server with the proper environment configuration
- For running tests:
  - Ensure you're in the correct API implementation directory
  - Use `python3 -m pdm run pytest [test_file_path]` to run specific tests
  - Use `python3 -m pdm run pytest tests/` to run all tests

## Unit Tests
- Focus on testing individual functions, methods, or components in isolation.
- Mock external dependencies to avoid side effects and ensure test speed.
- Use clear and descriptive test names.
- Each test should verify a single piece of behavior.
- **Python**: Use `pytest` as the primary testing framework. Store tests in the `tests/unit` directory or alongside the code they test.
- **Vue**: Use Vitest or Jest for component and utility function unit tests. Store tests in `__tests__` directories or alongside the component files (e.g., `src/components/__tests__/MyComponent.spec.js`).

## Integration Tests
- Test the interaction between multiple components or modules.
- For FastAPI, use `TestClient` to test API endpoints, including request/response validation and interaction with services.
- Store Python integration tests in `tests/integration`.
- Minimize mocking; use real dependencies where feasible (e.g., a test database).

## End-to-End (E2E) Tests
- Test complete user flows through the application.
- Use tools like Cypress or Playwright for frontend E2E testing.
- E2E tests are typically slower and more brittle, so focus on critical paths.

## Test Organization
- Maintain a clear directory structure for tests (e.g., `tests/unit`, `tests/integration`).
- Agent service integration tests should be located in `tests/integration/agents/[department_or_category]/[agent_name]/`. For example, tests for an invoice agent within the business department would be in `tests/integration/agents/business/invoice/`.
- Use descriptive file names for test files (e.g., `test_user_service.py`, `LoginFlow.e2e.js`).

## Code Coverage
- Strive for high code coverage, but prioritize quality of tests over quantity.
- Use coverage tools to identify untested code paths.

## Continuous Integration (CI)
- Integrate tests into the CI pipeline to run automatically on every push/PR.
- Ensure builds fail if tests do not pass.
